# This script reads all possible values of $slave.clothes as mentioned by the documentation.
# This script uses the actual implementation of the JS clothing2artSuffix function as defined in src/art/vector/Helper_Functions.tw
# This script outputs suffixes to be used in the SVG naming scheme
# This script is meant to be executed at the project root directory.
# This script depends on bash, grep, sed, paste and nodejs (so best executed on Linux, I guess)

# grep -Porh '(?<=\.clothes = )"[^"]+"' src/ | sort | uniq # searches sources for all clothes strings actually used in the game, even undocumented ones
