You arrive at your new arcology, $arcologies[0].name, and head straight to the penthouse to enter the access codes that will tell the $arcologies[0].name systems to recognize you as their owner. The penthouse office is ready to receive the codes, and they authenticate. A voice activates in your earpiece.
<br><br>
//Congratulations. I am a personal assistant program, and it is my pleasure to assist you, $PCName, the new owner of  $arcologies[0].name. I will offer useful information whenever possible in italics.
<br><br>
Your new arcology has some unusual equipment. The previous owner kept a small stable of sex slaves. The penthouse therefore has a body modification studio for tattooing, bleaching and piercing, and an auto salon for more prosaic things like hair care. It also has a remote surgery, a small surgical theater that can be operated remotely by a qualified surgeon if you can pay the fee. Finally, it has a slave nutrition system connected to the arcology's hydroponics bays. This system produces a tasty protein-rich drink that provides the physically active female body all its necessary nutrients while leaving the lower digestive tract extremely clean. It even causes a mild increase in sex drive.
<br><br>
The previous owner seems to have left in something of a hurry. <<if $saveImported == 1>>Since it took some time for you to move your personal entourage into $arcologies[0].name, he had the time to get most of his things away.<<else>>He could not get all of his personal effects away.<</if>>//
