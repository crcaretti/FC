You extend a <<if $PC.title == 1>>manly<<else>>feminine<</if>> hand and graze your fingertips along the line of her cheekbone.
<<if ($activeSlave.lipsTat != 0)>>

<<if ($activeSlave.relationship == -3)>>
	<<if $activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken">>
		Her mouth opens to accept the kiss, and is compliant with your questing tongue. You kiss your broken wife deeply. Her posture remains completely unchanged. Being kissed affects her as little as being penetrated, being struck, being loved, or being your wife: not at all. When you pull away,
		<<if canSee($activeSlave)>>
			her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes track you carefully, awaiting further use of her body.
		<<else>>
			she exposes herself to you, awaiting further use of her body.
		<</if>>
	<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion+$activeSlave.trust >= 175>>
		Her mouth accepts yours with love, matching itself perfectly to your insistent lips and tongue.<<if ($activeSlave.teeth == "pointy")>> (Though you're quite careful around her sharp dentition.)<</if>> She melts into you, sighing ever so gently. When you finally break the kiss, her mouth freezes in the shape it was in when last your lips touched, and a momentary look of longing crosses her face.<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> A hand reaches dumbly up to her mouth to trace her lips where yours last touched.<</if>>

		<</if>>
	<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion < -20 && $activeSlave.trust > 20>>
		She reflexively turns her head away from you, but you catch your wife by her jaw and kiss her harder. You wrap your arms around her so she can not escape. She wriggles desperately, but her struggles slowly subside as she realizes that you're not taking this any farther. When you bore of it and pull away, she glares at you.
		<<if (($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave)))>>
			Her <<if canSee($activeSlave)>>eyes demand<<else>>expression demands<</if>> an answer: are you done?
		<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>
			She signs irritably, asking if you're done.
		<<else>>
			She splutters, "Are you done, <<Master>>?
		<</if>>
	<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion < -20>>
		She is nearly frozen with fear, and does not resist as you kiss her deeply. In fact, she barely reacts at all. She opens her mouth mechanically in response to your insistent tongue, but it's like kissing a doll. She is so filled with terror that she remains stiff even as it becomes clear to her you're not going to hurt her. When you bore of making out with your wife and pull away, she stares at you in utter incomprehension.
		<<if (($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave)))>>
			Her <<if canSee($activeSlave)>>eyes beg<<else>>expression begs<</if>> for an answer: is that it?
		<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>
			She signs spastically, begging fearfully to know if that's it.
		<<else>>
			She asks nervously before cringing, "I-i<<s>> that it, <<Master>>?"
		<</if>>
	<<else>>
		She accepts the kiss willingly. As you are so close to her, you sense considerable turmoil in the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>girl<</if>>; she's doing her duty as a wife by complying with your wishes, and is probably struggling with the mixture of resistance, obedience and perhaps even devotion forced to the forefront of her mind by your lips and tongue. When you finally break the kiss, <<if canSee($activeSlave)>>her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes gaze into yours searchingly<<else>>she gazes at you<</if>>, looking for answers that are not there.

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "dom") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	She giggles into you and kisses you back with vigor, her head pressing insistently forward. The two of you make out rather aggressively<<if ($activeSlave.teeth == "pointy")>>, her sharp teeth drawing a bit of blood from your lips and tongue<</if>>. She takes her tendency towards sexual dominance right up to the edge of insubordination, her active tongue only retreating when yours presses against it. When you finally shove her away, she's breathing hard through her grin.

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "cumslut") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	She stiffens with arousal. Her sexuality is complex, focusing on cum, but with a heavy layer of oral fixation. As your tongue plunders her mouth, she reacts almost as though she's receiving oral, whimpering and moaning into you and pressing herself lewdly against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>prominent breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>.<<if ($activeSlave.teeth == "pointy")>> She's very careful to avoid spearing your tongue with her sharp teeth.<</if>> She achieves a weak orgasm before you tire of making out with her.
	<<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>
	Her mouth accepts yours with devotion, matching itself carefully to your insistent lips and tongue.<<if ($activeSlave.teeth == "pointy")>> She is exquisitely careful to keep her sharp teeth clear of you.<</if>> She presses herself against you, her warmth wonderful against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>. When you finally break the kiss, she runs her tongue rapturously across her moistened lips<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> and then runs a finger across them as well<</if>>, an openly sexual look on her $activeSlave.skin face.
	<<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	She accepts the kiss fearfully. As you kiss her unresisting mouth, her eagerness to avoid punishment leads her to kiss you back, though nervousness makes her mechanical. You kiss her harder, enjoying her fear, and the physical intimacy slowly does its work. She becomes softer and more natural, her resistance easing. When you pull away from her for a moment, she <<if canSee($activeSlave)>>looks<<else>>gazes<</if>> at you for a long moment, her mouth still hanging open, before visibly catching herself with a reminder that she's a slave and you're her owner.
