/*
 * We're making changes to the DOM, so we need to make them *after* everything has been generated
 * Sticking this all in postdisplay calls reduces the chance of there being a timing conflict
 *   with other scripts, since anything poking the DOM here will be done last
 *
 * Dev Note: The accordion mod should be able to turn *anything* into an accordion. This iteration
 *   is configured tightly for the end of week report runs, but it shouldn't be that hard to adapt for 
 *   other uses, like character bios. For now, I'll see what other extra-long passages of cosmetic text
 *   might benefit.
