	The command terrifies _him, but _he's more frightened still of the consequences of disobedience, and _he complies. Once _he's close, you take _his trembling head in your hands and gaze deeply into _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes for a moment. _He looks down fearfully, and begins to shake with terror, tears streaking down _his cheeks.
<<else>>
	_He pauses, obviously considering whether to resist, but eventually decides to save _his strength to fight more onerous orders, and gives in. Once _he's close, you take a moment to gaze deeply into _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. _He stares back, but after a few moments _he loses the contest of wills and looks down.

<<else>>
	_His massive tits are too large for you to wrap your arms around so you start to wrap your arms around _his waist. You feel _his heart beat against your chest, _he starts to breathe faster as you press _his back against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>bosom<<else>>chest<</if>>.
<</if>>

<<if ($activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken")>>
	_His posture doesn't change. _He initially only reacts slightly to your physical touch but eventually _he relaxes in the warmth of the your embrace against _his. You know that this may only be a physiological reaction, nothing more. For a brief moment you think you detect a spark of life in _his dull eyes but just as quickly, it is gone. When you stop, _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes track the movements of your hands briefly but then _he stares blankly ahead of _him, not understanding what is happening.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -2)>>
	In the warmth of your embrace, _he turns towards you, _his passionate $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes staring intently at your face. _He leans closer to you and kisses you as you hold _him. _His heart beats faster and then gradually slows as _he grows accustomed to your body against hers. Eventually, _he relaxes totally and _his eyes gradually close, melting in your arms. When you finally stop and relax your embrace, _his eyes remain closed and _his mouth still in a rapturous shape for a moment before _he slowly opens _his eyes and smiles at you with a blissful look on _his face. <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> _His hand reaches to your arms and _he strokes them longingly.<</if>> <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He slowly opens them and does _his best to communicate love with _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He signs that _he loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," _he lisps dreamily.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," _he says dreamily.<</if>> _He looks at you, almost begging you with _his eyes that _he wants much more than a mere embrace.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "dom") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	In your soft, warm embrace, _he tries hard to stop _himself from losing _himself in your arms. 
	<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> _He starts to embrace you in _his arms as well. When you gently squeeze _him in your arms, _he breathes more heavily and starts to lovingly squeeze you as well, _his tendency towards sexual dominance encouraging _him to compete with you in embraces against each other.
	<<else>> When you gently squeeze _him in your arms, _he breathes more heavily before relaxing against you.
	<</if>>
	When you finally stop and relax your embrace, _his eyes are closed and _he's smiling blissfully.
	<<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He slowly opens them and does _his best to communicate excitement with _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.
	<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He signs that _he liked that.
	<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"That wath fun, <<Master>>," _he lisps cheerfully.
	<<else>>"That was fun, <<Master>>," _he says cheerfully.
	<</if>>
	_He eagerly looks at you, _his eyes almost seem to say that _he wants you to give _his <<Master>> more than a mere hug.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>
	_He sighs devotedly in your arms and slowly relaxes. _He turns towards you, _his doting $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes staring intently at your face. You feel _his heart beating faster against your chest as you softly squeeze your arms tighter. _His hands reach to your arms and _he strokes them longingly as you squeeze. _He gradually closes _his eyes as _he leans _his body against yours, melting in your warm embrace, and you feel the intense heat from _his body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>. When you finally stop, <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>>_he reaches to your face with _his hand and gently strokes your cheek<</if>>, a euphoric look on _his $activeSlave.skin face. <<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>_He does _his best to communicate devotion with _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes, since _he's not confident in _his ability to express it in $language.<<elseif ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He does _his best to communicate devotion with _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He signs that _he loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," _he lisps elatedly.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," _he says elatedly.<</if>> _He looks at you longingly, almost as if _he's bursting to say that _he wants more than a mere embrace.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>
	_He willingly gives _himself up to your embracing arms. As you are so close to _him, you sense considerable uneasiness in the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>girl<</if>>; _he's doing _his duty as a slave by complying with your wishes, and is probably struggling with the mixture of resistance, obedience and perhaps even devotion forced to the forefront of _his mind by your soft embrace against _his body. _He gradually closes _his eyes in the feeling of your gentle arms. When you finally stop and relax your embrace, _his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes open to gaze puzzlingly at you. Even though _he has accepted life as a sex slave, _he looks as though _he is unsure of what to make of this non-sexual physical contact. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>_He asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>_He asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	_He shakes at your touch fearfully. As you softly press _his trembling body against you, _his eagerness to avoid punishment leads _him to stiffen in your arms. While _he continues to shudder, you continue embracing _him, enjoying _his fear, and the physical intimacy slowly does its work. _He starts to relax, _his resistance easing and _his eyes start to close. When you relax your arms for a moment, _he opens _his eyes to look at you for a long moment, _his eyes darting up to your face, before visibly catching _himself with a reminder that _he's a slave and you're _his owner. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>_He asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>_He asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -50)>>
	_He is nearly frozen with fear, and does not resist as you start to squeeze your arms around _him. In fact, _he barely reacts at all. _He stares at your arms as they continue squeezing, but it's like touching a statue. _He is so filled with terror that _he remains stiff even as it becomes clear to _him you're not going to hurt _him. When you bore of embracing the still <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>girl<</if>> and release _him, _he stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He signs spastically, begging fearfully to know if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>_He asks nervously, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>_He asks nervously, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>> Then _he cringes, unsure of what you are going to do next.
<<else>>
	_He reflexively tries to break free from your arms, but you keep _him wrapped in them. Shuddering, _he desperately leans away from you, but you tip forward with _him and pin _him against your desk, continuing your hold on _him. _He tries to wriggle out of your grasp desperately, but _his struggles slowly subside as _he realizes that you're not taking this any farther. When you bore of it and release _him, _he stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_His eyes demand an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>_He signs irritably, asking whether that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>_He splutters, "Ith that it, <<Master>>!?"<<else>>_He splutters, "Is that it, <<Master>>!?"<</if>> _He shakes uncontrollably, apprehensive at what you are going to do next.
