<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust > -20)>>
	She visibly considers disobedience, but decides that complying with such an apparently harmless order is safe, for now. Once she's close, you take her head in your hands and gaze deeply into her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.

<<else>>

Once she's close, you take a moment to gaze deeply into her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. She stares back, but after a few moments she loses the contest of wills and looks down.
<</if>>

You walk around her and put your hands around her abdomen,<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> to gently pull her close towards you<<else>> moving close towards her on your desk<</if>> and then wrap your arms around her shoulders.<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> When you press your hips against hers,<<else>> You use your arms to prop her up against you,<</if>> <<if ($activeSlave.trust > 20)>>letting her lean while taking the weight of her against you<<else>>she tries to lean away from you, pushing against your arms<</if>>.

<<else>>
	Her massive tits are too large for you to wrap your arms around so you start to wrap your arms around her waist. You feel her heart beat against your chest, she starts to breathe faster as you press her back against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>bosom<<else>>chest<</if>>.
<</if>>

<<if ($activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken")>>
	Her posture doesn't change. She initially only reacts slightly to your physical touch but eventually she relaxes in the warmth of the your embrace against her. You know that this may only be a physiological reaction, nothing more. For a brief moment you think you detect a spark of life in her dull eyes but just as quickly, it is gone. When you stop, her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes track the movements of your hands briefly but then she stares blankly ahead of her, not understanding what is happening.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -2)>>
	In the warmth of your embrace, she turns towards you, her passionate $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes staring intently at your face. She leans closer to you and kisses you as you hold her. Her heart beats faster and then gradually slows as she grows accustomed to your body against hers. Eventually, she relaxes totally and her eyes gradually close, melting in your arms. When you finally stop and relax your embrace, her eyes remain closed and her mouth still in a rapturous shape for a moment before she slowly opens her eyes and smiles at you with a blissful look on her face. <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> Her hand reaches to your arms and she strokes them longingly.<</if>> <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (canTalk($activeSlave) == false)>>She slowly opens them and does her best to communicate love with her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>She signs that she loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," she lisps dreamily.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," she says dreamily.<</if>> She looks at you, almost begging you with her eyes that she wants much more than a mere embrace.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "dom") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	In your soft, warm embrace, she tries hard to stop herself from losing herself in your arms. <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> She starts to embracing you in her arms as well. When you gently squeeze her in your arms, she breathes more heavily and starts to lovingly squeeze you as well, her tendency towards sexual dominance encouraging her to compete with you in embraces against each other.<<else>> When you gently squeeze her in your arms, she breathes more heavily before relaxing against you.<</if>> When you finally stop and relax your embrace, her eyes are closed and she's smiling blissfully. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (canTalk($activeSlave) == false)>>She slowly opens them and does her best to communicate excitement with her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>She signs that she liked that.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"That wath fun, <<Master>>," she lisps cheerfully.<<else>>"That was fun, <<Master>>," she says cheerfully.<</if>> She eagerly looks at you, her eyes almost seem to say that she wants you to give her more than a mere hug.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>
	She sighs devotedly in your arms and slowly relaxes. She turns towards you, her doting $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes staring intently at your face. You feel her heart beating faster against your chest as you softly squeeze your arms tighter. Her hands reach to your arms and she strokes them longingly as you squeeze. She gradually closes her eyes as she leans her body against yours, melting in your warm embrace, and you feel the intense heat from her body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>. When you finally stop, <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>>she reaches to your face with her hand and gently strokes your cheek<</if>>, a euphoric look on her $activeSlave.skin face. <<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>She does her best to communicate devotion with her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes, since she's not confident in her ability to express it in $language.<<elseif ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (canTalk($activeSlave) == false)>>She does her best to communicate devotion with her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>She signs that she loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," she lisps elatedly.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," she says elatedly.<</if>> She looks at you longingly, almost as if she's bursting to say that she wants more than a mere embrace.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>
	She willingly gives herself up to your embracing arms. As you are so close to her, you sense considerable uneasiness in the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>girl<</if>>; she's doing her duty as a slave by complying with your wishes, and is probably struggling with the mixture of resistance, obedience and perhaps even devotion forced to the forefront of her mind by your soft embrace against her body. She gradually closes her eyes in the feeling of your gentle arms. When you finally stop and relax your embrace, her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes open to gaze puzzlingly at you. Even though she has accepted life as a sex slave, she looks as though she is unsure of what to make of this non-sexual physical contact. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (canTalk($activeSlave) == false)>>Her eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>She signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>She asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>She asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	She shakes at your touch fearfully. As you softly press her trembling body against you, her eagerness to avoid punishment leads her to stiffen in your arms. While she continues to shudder, you continue embracing her, enjoying her fear, and the physical intimacy slowly does its work. She starts to relax, her resistance easing and her eyes start to close. When you relax your arms for a moment, she opens her eyes to look at you for a long moment, her eyes darting up to your face, before visibly catching herself with a reminder that she's a slave and you're her owner. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (canTalk($activeSlave) == false)>>Her eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>She signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>She asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>She asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -50)>>
	She is nearly frozen with fear, and does not resist as you start to squeeze your arms around her. In fact, she barely reacts at all. She stares at your arms as they continue squeezing, but it's like touching a statue. She is so filled with terror that she remains stiff even as it becomes clear to her you're not going to hurt her. When you bore of embracing the still <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>girl<</if>> and release her, she stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (canTalk($activeSlave) == false)>>Her eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>She signs spastically, begging fearfully to know if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>She asks nervously, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>She asks nervously, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>> Then she cringes, unsure of what you are going to do next.
<<else>>
	She reflexively tries to break free from your arms, but you keep her wrapped in them. Shuddering, she desperately leans away from you, but you tip forward with her and pin her against your desk, continuing your hold on her. She tries to wriggle out of your grasp desperately, but her struggles slowly subside as she realizes that you're not taking this any farther. When you bore of it and release her, she stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (canTalk($activeSlave) == false)>>Her eyes demand an answer: is that it?<<elseif canTalk($activeSlave) == false>>She signs irritably, asking whether that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>She splutters, "Ith that it, <<Master>>!?"<<else>>She splutters, "Is that it, <<Master>>!?"<</if>> She shakes uncontrollably, apprehensive at what you are going to do next.
