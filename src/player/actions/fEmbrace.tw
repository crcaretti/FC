	<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion+$activeSlave.trust >= 175>>
		$He lovingly complies, hurrying to come close to the <<if $PC.title == 1>>man<<else>>woman<</if>> who married $him.

	<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion < -20>>
		$He complies out of fear. Once $he's close, you take your unwilling wife's head in your hands and gaze deeply into $his teary $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He finds the intense look from the <<if $PC.title == 1>>man<<else>>woman<</if>> $he's forcibly married to terrifying, and <<if canSee($activeSlave)>> breaks eye contact<<else>> turns $his face away<</if>>.
	<<else>>

	<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 75)>>
	$He elatedly complies, joyful at being near to you. Once $he's close, you take $his completely relaxed head in your hands and gaze deeply into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He finds the intense look from $his beloved <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title == 1>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>> disconcerting, and $his eyes flick downward after a moment. $He blushes furiously.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>
	$He dotingly complies, being near you filling $his with delight. Once $he's close, you take $his completely relaxed head in your hands and gaze deeply into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He finds the intense attention from $his <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title == 1>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>> disconcerting, and $he looks down after a moment, blushing.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>
	$He joyfully complies, happy to be near you.

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust > -20)>>
	$He visibly considers disobedience, but decides that complying with such an apparently harmless order is safe, for now. Once $he's close, you take $his head in your hands and gaze deeply into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He finds the intense attention from $his <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title == 1>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>> worrying, and $he looks down after a moment, $his lower lip trembling with nervousness.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	The command terrifies $him, but $he's more frightened still of the consequences of disobedience, and $he complies. Once $he's close, you take $his trembling head in your hands and gaze deeply into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes for a moment. $He looks down fearfully, and begins to shake with terror, tears streaking down $his cheeks.
<<else>>
	$He pauses, obviously considering whether to resist, but eventually decides to save $his strength to fight more onerous orders, and gives in. Once $he's close, you take a moment to gaze deeply into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He stares back, but after a few moments $he loses the contest of wills and looks down.
<</if>>

You walk around $him and put your hands around $his abdomen,<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> to gently pull $him close towards you<<else>> moving close towards $him on your desk<</if>> and then wrap your arms around $his shoulders.<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> When you press your hips against $hers,<<else>> You use your arms to prop $him up against you,<</if>> <<if ($activeSlave.trust > 20)>>letting $him lean while taking the weight of $his against you<<else>>$he tries to lean away from you, pushing against your arms<</if>>. You lovingly squeeze $him in your long, cradling embrace.

	hands as you move your arms down around $his breasts. <<if ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>You take your time to stay in this position, feeling $his heart beat against you. $He starts to breathe faster before you keep one arm wrapped around $him as you move to $his front<<else>>As you move to $his front, with one arm still around $him, $he again tries to break away but you keep $him held tightly and you whisper the alternatives to $him, reminding $him<</if>>. You wrap your arms around $his back as you press $his breasts against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>bosom<<else>>chest<</if>>.
<<else>>
	$His massive tits are too large for you to wrap your arms around so you start to wrap your arms around $his waist. You feel $his heart beat against your chest, $he starts to breathe faster as you press $his back against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>bosom<<else>>chest<</if>>.
<</if>>

<<if ($activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken")>>
	$His posture doesn't change. $He initially only reacts slightly to your physical touch but eventually $he relaxes in the warmth of the your embrace against $him. You know that this may only be a physiological reaction, nothing more. For a brief moment you think you detect a spark of life in $his dull eyes but just as quickly, it is gone. When you stop, $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes track the movements of your hands briefly but then $he stares blankly ahead of $him, not understanding what is happening.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -2)>>
	In the warmth of your embrace, $he turns towards you, $his passionate $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes staring intently at your face. $He leans closer to you and kisses you as you hold $him. $His heart beats faster and then gradually slows as $he grows accustomed to your body against $hers. Eventually, $he relaxes totally and $his eyes gradually close, melting in your arms. When you finally stop and relax your embrace, $his eyes remain closed and $his mouth still in a rapturous shape for a moment before $he slowly opens $his eyes and smiles at you with a blissful look on $his face. <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> $His hand reaches to your arms and $he strokes them longingly.<</if>> <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He slowly opens them and does $his best to communicate love with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs that $he loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he lisps dreamily.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he says dreamily.<</if>> $He looks at you, almost begging you with $his eyes that $he wants much more than a mere embrace.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "dom") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	In your soft, warm embrace, $he tries hard to stop $himself from losing $himself in your arms. 
	<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> $He starts to embrace you in $his arms as well. When you gently squeeze $him in your arms, $he breathes more heavily and starts to lovingly squeeze you as well, $his tendency towards sexual dominance encouraging $him to compete with you in embraces against each other.
	<<else>> When you gently squeeze $him in your arms, $he breathes more heavily before relaxing against you.
	<</if>>
	When you finally stop and relax your embrace, $his eyes are closed and $he's smiling blissfully.
	<<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He slowly opens them and does $his best to communicate excitement with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.
	<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs that $he liked that.
	<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"That wath fun, <<Master>>," $he lisps cheerfully.
	<<else>>"That was fun, <<Master>>," $he says cheerfully.
	<</if>>
	$He eagerly looks at you, $his eyes almost seem to say that $he wants you to give $his <<Master>> more than a mere hug.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>
	$He sighs devotedly in your arms and slowly relaxes. $He turns towards you, $his doting $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes staring intently at your face. You feel $his heart beating faster against your chest as you softly squeeze your arms tighter. $His hands reach to your arms and $he strokes them longingly as you squeeze. $He gradually closes $his eyes as $he leans $his body against yours, melting in your warm embrace, and you feel the intense heat from $his body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>. When you finally stop, <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>>$he reaches to your face with $his hand and gently strokes your cheek<<else>>$he turns to you<</if>>, a euphoric look on $his $activeSlave.skin face. <<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>$He does $his best to communicate devotion with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes, since $he's not confident in $his ability to express it in $language.<<elseif ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He does $his best to communicate devotion with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs that $he loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he lisps elatedly.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he says elatedly.<</if>> $He looks at you longingly, almost as if $he's bursting to say that $he wants more than a mere embrace.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>
	$He willingly gives $himself up to your embracing arms. As you are so close to $him, you sense considerable uneasiness in the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>$girl<</if>>; $he's doing $his duty as a slave by complying with your wishes, and is probably struggling with the mixture of resistance, obedience and perhaps even devotion forced to the forefront of $his mind by your soft embrace against $his body. $He gradually closes $his eyes in the feeling of your gentle arms. When you finally stop and relax your embrace, $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes open to gaze puzzlingly at you. Even though $he has accepted life as a sex slave, $he looks as though $he is unsure of what to make of this non-sexual physical contact. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	$He shakes at your touch fearfully. As you softly press $his trembling body against you, $his eagerness to avoid punishment leads $him to stiffen in your arms. While $he continues to shudder, you continue embracing $him, enjoying $his fear, and the physical intimacy slowly does its work. $He starts to relax, $his resistance easing and $his eyes start to close. When you relax your arms for a moment, $he opens $his eyes to look at you for a long moment, $his eyes darting up to your face, before visibly catching $himself with a reminder that $he's a slave and you're $his owner. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -50)>>
	$He is nearly frozen with fear, and does not resist as you start to squeeze your arms around $him. In fact, $he barely reacts at all. $He stares at your arms as they continue squeezing, but it's like touching a statue. $He is so filled with terror that $he remains stiff even as it becomes clear to $him you're not going to hurt $him. When you bore of embracing the still <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>$girl<</if>> and release $him, $he stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs spastically, begging fearfully to know if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He asks nervously, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>$He asks nervously, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>> Then $he cringes, unsure of what you are going to do next.
<<else>>
	$He reflexively tries to break free from your arms, but you keep $him wrapped in them. Shuddering, $he desperately leans away from you, but you tip forward with $him and pin $him against your desk, continuing your hold on $him. $He tries to wriggle out of your grasp desperately, but $his struggles slowly subside as $he realizes that you're not taking this any farther. When you bore of it and release $him, $he stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$His eyes demand an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs irritably, asking whether that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He splutters, "Ith that it, <<Master>>!?"<<else>>$He splutters, "Is that it, <<Master>>!?"<</if>> $He shakes uncontrollably, apprehensive at what you are going to do next.
