<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -2)>>

	<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion < -20>>
		$He complies out of fear. Once $he's close, you hold $his shaking face in your palms and look into $his teary $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He finds the intense look from the <<if $PC.title == 1>>man<<else>>woman<</if>> $he's forcibly married to terrifying, and <<if canSee($activeSlave)>> breaks eye contact<<else>> turns $his face away<</if>>.
	<<else>>

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 75)>>
	$He hurriedly complies, happy to be near you. Once $he's close, you hold $his face in your palms and look into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He finds the intense look from $his beloved <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title == 1>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>> disconcerting, and $his eyes flick downward after a moment. $He blushes furiously.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>

	$He hurriedly complies, happy to be near you.

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust > -20)>>
	$He visibly considers disobedience, but decides that complying with such an apparently harmless order is safe, for now. Once $he's close, you hold $his face in your palms and look into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He finds the intense attention from $his <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title == 1>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>> worrying, and $he looks down after a moment, $his lower lip trembling with nervousness.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	The command terrifies $him, but $he's more frightened still of the consequences of disobedience, and $he complies. Once $he's close, you hold $his face in your palms and look into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He looks down fearfully, and begins to shake with terror, tears leaking silently down $his cheeks.
<<else>>
	$He pauses, obviously considering whether to resist, but eventually decides to save $his strength to fight more onerous orders, and gives in. Once $he's close, you hold $his face in your palms and look into $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes. $He stares back, but after a few moments $he loses the contest of wills and looks down.

You delicately lift $his head and touch your fingertips to $his chin, tenderly brushing along the line of $his mouth with your <<if $PC.title == 1>>manly<<else>>feminine<</if>> thumb.
<<if ($activeSlave.lipsTat != 0)>>
	Your fingers trace $his facial tattoos, slowly picking out the patterns against $his $activeSlave.skin skin.
<</if>>
<<if ($activeSlave.lipsPiercing+$activeSlave.tonguePiercing > 2)>>
	You touch each of $his facial piercings, one by one, feeling the hard metal contrast with $his pliant flesh.
<</if>>
Then, you gently tilt $his <<if $activeSlave.face > 95>>overwhelmingly stunning<<elseif $activeSlave.face > 10>>alluring<<elseif $activeSlave.face >= -10>>appealing<<elseif $activeSlave.face >= -40>>plain<<else>>rough<</if>> head back and lightly touch $his

	lips
<</if>> with your fingertips. You use your fingers and thumbs to slowly slide along $his mouth, $his chin, $his cheeks then around $his face. You use a deft touch to thoroughly explore the shape of $his <<if $activeSlave.face > 95>>gorgeous<<elseif $activeSlave.face > 10>>nice<<elseif $activeSlave.face >= -10>>cute<<elseif $activeSlave.face >= -40>>fair<<else>>prominent<</if>> cheekbones. Grazing $his temple and brushing $his forehead simultaneously, you smoothly motion along $his eyelids and nose and you tenderly stroke $his face with both hands as you take $his head lightly and trace around it, gently massaging as you go. You work your way down, slowly and gradually, along $his neck with one hand, then the other, briefly pausing before continuing your path down to $his shoulders and<<if ($activeSlave.fetish != "mindbroken")>> $he starts to gasp as<<else>> starts to shudder as<</if>> you slide your hands down $his side, across $his back and along $his belly taking every moment to savour the contours of $his body before going back up again to $his face.

<<if ($activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken")>>
	$His posture doesn't change. $He initially only reacts slightly to your physical touch but then stops reacting completely. When you stop, $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes track the movements of your hands briefly but then stare blankly ahead of $his, awaiting further use of $his body.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -2)>>
	$His eyes gradually close and $he slowly leans $his head back, relaxing as $he feels your caress. $He gently gasps as $he feels your warm <<if $PC.title == 1>>manly<<else>>feminine<</if>> hand. When you finally stop gently caressing $his, $his eyes remain closed and $his mouth still in a rapturous shape for a moment before $he slowly opens $his eyes and smiles at you, $he has an eager look on $his face.<<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>> A hand reaches dumbly up to $his face mimicking your last movements.<</if>> <<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>$He does $his best to communicate love with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes, since $he does not speak $language well enough to express $himself.<<elseif ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave))>>$He does $his best to communicate love with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs that $he loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he lisps dreamily.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he says dreamily.<</if>> $He looks as though $he wants much more than your mere caress.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "dom") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	As you start to touch $his <<if $activeSlave.face > 95>>gorgeous<<elseif $activeSlave.face > 10>>lovely<<elseif $activeSlave.face >= -10>>pretty<<elseif $activeSlave.face >= -40>>homely<<else>>ugly<</if>> face, $he smiles at you and takes your hand in $hers, following its movements. $He tries hard to stop $himself from losing $himself in your masterful hands. $He takes $his tendency towards sexual dominance right up to the edge of insubordination, when $he starts to caress your face in turn. When you finally stop, $his eyes are closed and $he's smiling. <<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>$He does $his best to communicate excitement with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes, since $he does not speak $language well enough to express $himself.<<elseif ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave))>>$He does $his best to communicate excitement with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs that $he liked that.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"That wath fun, <<Master>>," $he lisps cheerfully.<<else>>"That was fun, <<Master>>," $he says cheerfully.<</if>> $He looks at you, $his eyes almost begging you to give $his more than your mere caress.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "cumslut") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	$He stiffens at your touch but slowly relaxes to your fingers on $his face. As you move your fingers along $his lips, $he reacts almost as though $he's receiving oral. $He starts to gently suck your fingers, moaning into your hand and pressing $himself lewdly against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>prominent breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>.<<if ($activeSlave.teeth == "pointy")>> $He's very careful to avoid spearing your tongue with $his sharp teeth.<</if>> $He achieves a weak orgasm before you stop caressing $his. <<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>$He does $his best to communicate undiminished lust with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes, since $he does not speak $language well enough to express $himself.<<elseif ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave))>>$He does $his best to communicate undiminished lust with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs that $he liked that.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"That wath fun, <<Master>>," $he lisps lustfully.<<else>>"That was fun, <<Master>>," $he says lustfully.<</if>> $He looks at you as if $he wants more than your hands touching $him.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>
	$He accepts your touch with devotion, leaning $his head back at your gentle caress along $his face. $He leans $his body forward, pressing $himself against you, and you feel the intense heat from $his body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>. $He gradually closes $his eyes and when you finally stop, <<if ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>>$he runs $his hand delightfully across $his face where you last touched $his<</if>>, a euphoric look on $his $activeSlave.skin face. <<if ($activeSlave.accent >= 3)>>$He does $his best to communicate devotion with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes, since $he's not confident in $his ability to express it in $language.<<elseif ($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave))>>$He does $his best to communicate devotion with $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes.<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs that $he loves you.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he lisps jubilantly.<<else>>"I love you, <<Master>>," $he says jubilantly.<</if>> $He looks at you longingly, almost as if $he's bursting to say that $he wants more than your mere caress.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>
	$He accepts your touch willingly. As you are so close to $his, you sense considerable turmoil in the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>$girl<</if>>; $he's doing $his duty as a slave by complying with your wishes, and is probably struggling with the mixture of resistance, obedience and perhaps even devotion forced to the forefront of $his mind by your touch across $his face. When you finally move your hand away, $his $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes gaze into yours searchingly, looking for answers that are not there. <<if (($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave)))>>$His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	$He shakes at your touch fearfully. As you move your hand along $his unresisting face, $his eagerness to avoid punishment leads $his to stiffen, $his nervousness is made apparent. You continue stroking $his cheek, enjoying $his fear, and the physical intimacy slowly does its work. $He starts to relax, $his resistance easing and $his eyes start to close. When finally move your hand away, $he looks at you for a long moment, $his eyes darting up at you, before visibly catching $himself with a reminder that $he's a slave and you're $his owner. <<if (($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave)))>>$His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs hesitantly, asking if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>$He asks hesitantly, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>>
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -50)>>
	$He is nearly frozen with fear, and does not resist as you start to caress $his face. In fact, $he barely reacts at all. $He stares at you as you move your fingers across $his stiff face, but it's like touching a statue. $He is so filled with terror that $he remains stiff even as it becomes clear to $his you're not going to hurt $his. When you bore of touching the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>$girl<</if>> and move your hand away, $he stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if (($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave)))>>$His eyes beg for an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs spastically, begging fearfully to know if that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He asks nervously, "I-ith that it, <<Master>>?"<<else>>$He asks nervously, "I-is that it, <<Master>>?"<</if>> Then $he cringes.
<<else>>
	$He reflexively turns away from you, but you catch $his head with one hand and slowly but gently move your other hand along $his face. Spluttering, $he leans backwards, but you tip forward with $him and pin $him against your desk, not stopping your gentle touch on $his head. $He tries to wriggle out of your grasp desperately, but $his struggles slowly subside as $he realizes that you're not taking this any farther. When you bore of it and move your hand away, $he stares at you in utter incomprehension. <<if (($activeSlave.amp == 1) && (!canTalk($activeSlave)))>>$His eyes demand an answer: is that it?<<elseif !canTalk($activeSlave)>>$He signs irritably, asking whether that's it.<<elseif SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>$He splutters, "Ith that it, <<Master>>!?"<<else>>$He splutters, "Is that it, <<Master>>!?"<</if>>
