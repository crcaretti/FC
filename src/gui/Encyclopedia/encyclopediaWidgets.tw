<<widget "encyclopediaEntryServitude">>
''Servitude'' is an assignment which reduces your upkeep based on the slave's [[devotion|Encyclopedia][$encyclopedia = "Devotion"]]. Available at lower obedience than other jobs, is insensitive to the quality of a slave's body, and doesn't require skills; a good transitional assignment. Unusually, low sex drive is advantageous as a servant, since it reduces distraction. Lactating slaves are slightly better at this job, since they can contribute to their fellow slaves' nutrition.
