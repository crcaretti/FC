''This is an alpha.'' That means the game is missing content, is full of bugs, is imbalanced, and is generally in an incomplete state. The game will keep a start of turn autosave. If you encounter a bug, I strongly recommend you reload your start of turn autosave immediately. Bugs will occasionally cause a bugged slave named $activeSlave.slaveName (or similar) to appear. If this happens, use the "Discard her" option on the slave menu to get rid of her. Then, please report the circumstances (especially what random event you just saw) to the dev. Please submit your feedback and bug reports at https://www.reddit.com/r/freecitiesgame/ or at http://freecitiesblog.blogspot.com/.

An in-game encyclopedia is available from the sidebar (or [[here|Encyclopedia][$nextButton to "Back", $nextLink to passage()]] if you'd prefer to have a look before starting), with answers to most basic gameplay questions.

__Important note for new players, and a reminder for FC veterans:__ when the player is offered a set of choices, the ''Continue'' button at the top of the left sidebar will almost always remain available. Using this to decline all the options presented is //not cheating.// If it's available, it's supposed to be available. It represents the player character politely bowing out of the situation.

If you enjoy FC and feel like using your real-life Â¤ to express gratitude, you can do so at https://www.patreon.com/freecitiesdev?ty=h. It's a tip jar, not support for more content. I'm doing this for fun; let's keep it that way.
