:: Gender Intro

The Free Cities are sexually libertine places, and sexual slavery is ubiquitous. Some of the early Free Cities upheld or even strengthened traditional gender roles, expecting men to be men and women to be women. Others subscribed to an interesting refinement of those gender roles, considering any sex slave female, regardless of her biology. A small minority even went so far as to strongly favor societal feminization of slaves born male; in these, biologically female slaves were a rare sight. @@color:orange;Which kind of Free City came to predominate?@@
