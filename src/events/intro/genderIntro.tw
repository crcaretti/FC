:: Gender Intro
 
The Free Cities are sexually libertine places, and sexual slavery is ubiquitous. Some Free Cities have upheld or even strengthened traditional gender roles, expecting men to be men and women to be women. Others subscribe to an interesting refinement of those gender roles, considering any sex slave female, regardless of her biology. A small minority even go so far as to strongly favor societal feminization of slaves born male; in these, biologically female slaves are a rare sight. @@color:orange;Which kind of Free City is your new arcology located in?@@
