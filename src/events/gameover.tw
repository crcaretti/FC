:: Gameover [nobr]

<<if $gameover == "bombing">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	One fine day, you're strolling down the main promenade, making your usual combined inspection and public rounds. These walks are triply useful, since they allow you to keep a finger on the pulse of your demesne, identify any problems, and display yourself to the population.
	<br><br>
	<<if $assistantName == "your personal assistant">>Your personal assistant<<else>>$assistantName<</if>> suddenly relays a silent alarm, highlighting a scruffy individual twenty meters ahead. This person is hooded and acting oddly. You catch a glance from beneath the hood in your direction: and the figure obviously decides that it can get no closer to you. Your assistant's scanning detects the presence of an implanted bomb moments before the suicide bomber detonates themselves.
	<br><br>
	The implanted bomb is small, and went off too far ahead to do anything more than stun. Three other assailants run at you from where they were waiting in the confusion, wielding improvised weapons that apparently did not set off the security scanners. Without a bodyguard, decent security systems, or any other means of personal defense, you meet your ignominious death at the end of a bludgeon fashioned from a maintenance tool.

	''GAME OVER''
<<elseif $gameover == "idiot ball">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	You quickly move to deal $Bodyguard.slaveName a slap across the face. You have an instant to realize the depth of your folly as her combat training kicks into gear: before she realizes what she's doing, she has drawn her sword, blocked your slap (and incidentally, removed your hand in doing so), and buried the sword in your chest on the riposte. Her devotion returns to her as her combat instincts subside. As you fade, you see her eyes cloud with terrible, unhealable guilt; in one sure movement, she draws her weapon, sets it to semi-automatic, places it under her chin, and fires a single round.

	''GAME OVER''
<<elseif $gameover == "debt">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	You have fallen so far into debt that it is mere child's play for another slaveowner to purchase your debt, call it in, and enslave you. The story of your remaining years may be worth telling, but it must be told elsewhere.

	<br><br>
	''GAME OVER''
<<elseif $gameover == "birth complications">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	Again and again, you keep bearing down. As you grow more exhausted and are no closer to giving birth, you let out a feeble cry for help.
	<br>
	<br>
	Some of your slaves rush to your aid, but they don't know what to do; they helplessly watch as you slowly fade away. If only you had someone you could rely on at your side, perhaps this could have been avoided. At last, the medics arrive at $assistantName's order, but it is too late to save you or your child.

	<br><br>
	''GAME OVER''
<<elseif $gameover == "ownership">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	Since you no longer control a controlling interest in an arcology, your time of influence and power in the Free Cities is over. You remain wealthy, and your life after the part of it worth telling is not something worth regretting. A retirement full of decadence awaits you.

	<br><br>
	''GAME OVER''
<<elseif $gameover == "sisters">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	For the first time in a long time, you feel the need to verbalize a response, telling the matron that yes, you will join them. She seems to understand, and takes you by the hand in a surprisingly familial gesture, leading you towards the orgy. She tells you she loves you, and all her Sisters echo her. After a moments' surprise, you tell them you love them too, and feminine hands reach out to draw you into their communion. A young futa sucks your cock and then feeds you your own cum from her mouth. An older futa with an enormous penis displaces her and makes out with you while she fucks your pussy. After she finishes inside you she slides your erection inside her own womanhood and rides you while a younger futa fucks your cleavage. You have a free hand which someone fills by pressing an enormous soft breast against it and you oblige her by massaging it eagerly. The futa matron's pussy grows suddenly tighter as another futa starts to buttfuck her and then looser as the cock is removed and inserted into your asshole instead. When she cums inside you she pulls out and her cock is replaced by a greedy mouth and tongue whose owner you cannot see. The older futa presses her cockhead into a younger Sister's mouth and orgasms before sliding herself under you so you can be on top instead. A futa whispers that she wants to be closer to you and slides her cock inside the matron's pussy alongside yours as she nestles her face between your breasts.
	<br><br>
	Your appointed successor arrives in your old office to find $assistantName ready to help them take control of the arcology. Most of your assets have been liquidated to create a huge endowment for $arcologies[0].name's Sisters. They'll never have to sell one of their own again, and will be able to afford all the advanced drugs and surgeries they desire. From the most matronly futa down to their newest Sister, none of them need concern themselves with anything other than sex.

<<elseif $gameover == "major battle defeat">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	<<if $attackType == "raiders">>
		As the horde of raiders breaks the battle lines and enters the arcology, all hell breaks loose. You citizens are raped, your slaves captured and abused, your penthouse burned.
		As for you, you are quickly captured and brought in front of the warlord himself. With a satisfied smile he aims his pistol to your forehead and squeezes the trigger.
	<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
		As the interminable column of old world puppets breaks the battle lines and enters the arcology, all hell breaks loose. Properties are seized and wealth stolen and distributed between the victorious soldiers.
		You are stripped of everything you possessed and left to rot in a corner of your once glorious arcology.
	<<elseif $attackType == "freedom fighters">>
		As the army of freedom fighters invades the arcology, all hell breaks loose. Their righteous fury torches everything you held dear, while the streets of the arcology run red with the blood of the masters.
		You are reserved a special death: crucified in front of the arcology's entrance, your corpse a grim reminder of your legacy.
	<<elseif $attackType == "free city">>
		As the mercenaries break the battle lines and enter the arcology all hell breaks loose. The sectors are pillaged one by one, systematically and thoroughly. When they break in the penthouse they quickly capture and send you to their employers as proof of their success.
		Your personal story may continue, but that part of it worthy of retelling has now ended.

	''GAME OVER''
<<elseif $gameover == "Rebellion defeat">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	<<if $slaveRebellion == 1>>
		As the furious horde of slaves invades your penthouse you are left a few precious seconds to decide your fate. You embrace for the last time your faithful revolver and just as the rebels break through your doors you squeeze the trigger.
		The end of your story has come and your arcology is now in the hands of whoever will take control of the vermin that dared rise up this day.
	<<else>>
		As the furious horde of citizens invades your penthouse you are left a few precious seconds to decide your fate. You embrace for the last time your faithful revolver and just as the rebels break through your doors you squeeze the trigger.
		The end of your story has come and your arcology is now in the hands of whoever will take control of the vermin that dared rise up this day.

<<elseif $gameover == "Idiot Ball 2 The Dumbassening" || $gameover == "Idiot Ball 3 Totally Not Idiot Ball 2 Again">>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	As you leave your penthouse to conduct your daily rounds, you promptly get <<if $arcologyUpgrade.drones == 1>>tased by the nearest drone<<else>>tackled hard against the wall<</if>>. When you awake, it hits you like a truck; you idiotically enslaved your $PC.race ass by decreeing all <<if $gameover == "Idiot Ball 2 The Dumbassening">>non-<<print $arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace>><<else>><<print $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace>><</if>><<if $PC.race != "mixed race">>s<<else>> individuals<</if>> slaves, and since you are now a slave, lack the authority to revert the policy. The story of your remaining years may be worth telling, as is your legendary blunder, but it must be told elsewhere.

	<br><br>
	''GAME OVER''	

<<else>>
	<<set $ui = "start">>
	Since you are without slaves, Free Cities society no longer considers you a citizen of the first rank. Your personal story may continue, but that part of it worthy of retelling has now ended.
