:: Gameover [nobr]

<<set $ui = "start">>

<<if $gameover == "bombing">>

One fine day, you're strolling down the main promenade, making your usual combined inspection and public rounds. These walks are triply useful, since they allow you to keep a finger on the pulse of your demesne, identify any problems, and display yourself to the population.
<br><br>
<<if $assistantName == "your personal assistant">>Your personal assistant<<else>>$assistantName<</if>> suddenly relays a silent alarm, highlighting a scruffy individual twenty meters ahead. This person is hooded and acting oddly. You catch a glance from beneath the hood in your direction: and the figure obviously decides that it can get no closer to you. Your assistant's scanning detects the presence of an implanted bomb moments before the suicide bomber detonates themselves.
<br><br>
The implanted bomb is small, and went off too far ahead to do anything more than stun. Three other assailants run at you from where they were waiting in the confusion, wielding improvised weapons that apparently did not set off the security scanners. Without a bodyguard, decent security systems, or any other means of personal defense, you meet your ignominious death at the end of a bludgeon fashioned from a maintenance tool.

<<elseif $gameover == "idiot ball">>

You quickly move to deal $Bodyguard.slaveName a slap across the face. You have an instant to realize the depth of your folly as her combat training kicks into gear: before she realizes what she's doing, she has drawn her sword, blocked your slap (and incidentally, removed your hand in doing so), and buried the sword in your chest on the riposte. Her devotion returns to her as her combat instincts subside. As you fade, you see her eyes cloud with terrible, unhealable guilt; in one sure movement, she draws her weapon, sets it to semi-automatic, places it under her chin, and fires a single round.

<<elseif $gameover == "debt">>

You have fallen so far into debt that it is mere child's play for another slaveowner to purchase your debt, call it in, and enslave you. The story of your remaining years may be worth telling, but it must be told elsewhere.

<<elseif $gameover == "birth complications">>

Again and again, you keep bearing down. As you grow more exhausted and are no closer to giving birth, you let out a feeble cry for help.
<br>
<br>
Some of your slaves rush to your aid, but they don't know what to do; they helplessly watch as you slowly fade away. If only you had someone you could rely on at your side, perhaps this could have been avoided. At last, the medics arrive at $assistantName's order, but it is too late to save you or your child.

<<elseif $gameover == "ownership">>

Since you no longer control a controlling interest in an arcology, your time of influence and power in the Free Cities is over. You remain wealthy, and your life after the part of it worth telling is not something worth regretting. A retirement full of decadence awaits you.

<<elseif $gameover == "sisters">>

For the first time in a long time, you feel the need to verbalize a response, telling the matron that yes, you will join them. She seems to understand, and takes you by the hand in a surprisingly familial gesture, leading you towards the orgy. She tells you she loves you, and all her Sisters echo her. After a moments' surprise, you tell them you love them too, and feminine hands reach out to draw you into their communion. A young futa sucks your cock and then feeds you your own cum from her mouth. An older futa with an enormous penis displaces her and makes out with you while she fucks your pussy. After she finishes inside you she slides your erection inside her own womanhood and rides you while a younger futa fucks your cleavage. You have a free hand which someone fills by pressing an enormous soft breast against it and you oblige her by massaging it eagerly. The futa matron's pussy grows suddenly tighter as another futa starts to buttfuck her and then looser as the cock is removed and inserted into your asshole instead. When she cums inside you she pulls out and her cock is replaced by a greedy mouth and tongue whose owner you cannot see. The older futa presses her cockhead into a younger Sister's mouth and orgasms before sliding herself under you so you can be on top instead. A futa whispers that she wants to be closer to you and slides her cock inside the matron's pussy alongside yours as she nestles her face between your breasts.
<br><br>
Your appointed successor arrives in your old office to find $assistantName ready to help them take control of the arcology. Most of your assets have been liquidated to create a huge endowment for $arcologyName's Sisters. They'll never have to sell one of their own again, and will be able to afford all the advanced drugs and surgeries they desire. From the most matronly futa down to their newest Sister, none of them need concern themselves with anything other than sex.

<<elseif $gameover == "you failed">>

You knew this day would come.
<br><br>
Surrounding yourself with powerful has its boons, but also poses a distinct threat. You've heard them murmuring when you enter the room, you've seen them excuse themselves from your presence, and lately they've been overtly hostile. The Societal Elite have turned on you.
<br><br>
You look up from your desk as the locked door to your office unseals, and a dozen individuals brazenly walk into your view.<<if $Bodyguard != 0>> $Bodyguard.slaveName stands between you and them. A single glare from the leader of the bunch and she backs off, eyes to the ground.<</if>>
<br><br>
<<if $PC.pregSource == -1>>
	<<if $PC.refreshmentType == 0>>Taking a drag from a fresh $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 1>>Taking a drink of a fresh glass of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 2>>Taking a bite of a fresh $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 3>>Doing a line of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 4>>Injecting a hit of $PC.refreshment into your arm<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 5>>Swallowing a $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 6>>Placing a tab of $PC.refreshment under your tongue<</if>>, you greet your rather unwelcome guests.
<br><br>
"You are no longer worthy of being a part of our society. But you carry within you one of our heirs. A conundrum for some, but we have already solved that problem."
<br><br>
What was that last thing he said? It's getting hard to think right. The $PC.refreshement... Drugged... You collapse onto your desk, unconscious.
<br><br>
You'll spend the rest of your life a breeder to the Societal Elite; blinded and muted. More than a slave, but still less than your master. Life isn't so bad, your two most devoted slaves were taking along to keep you happy, and you are treated quite well, possiblities considered. Though once your eggs dry up, odds are your little remaining usefulness will be at an end. Best not to think to much into it.
<<else>>
The leader reaches into his jacket and extracts a syringe, you recognize it as a powerful drug used in lobotomies, and places it to your left. From his hip he pulls a revolver, six-chambered, and loads five bullets, spins the chamber, and places it to your right. 
<br><br>
"You are no longer worthy of being a part of our society. You know you can't be allowed to spread any information. But we are not merciless, one of our members has taken an interest in having you as her pet. You may choose to lose your mind, and service her until she tires of you, or gamble for your life and serve her anyway. Now Decide."
<br><br>
The choice is simple, you will not be a slave.
You pick up the revolver and hold the barrel to your temple.
Mercy smiles on you today; your death was painless.
<</if>>

<<else>>

Since you are without slaves, Free Cities society no longer considers you a citizen of the first rank. Your personal story may continue, but that part of it worthy of retelling has now ended.
