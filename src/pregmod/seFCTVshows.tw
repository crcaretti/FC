	<<if $randShow == 1 && $showOne > 3 || $showOne == 1>>
		The segment is being anchored by the middle aged Kirk McMahon, and he's joined by the ever-popular "Anchor Slave", Jules. She's got a nice figure, and the only thing she's wearing to cover her perky breasts are a pair of FCNN pasties. She has on a fine leather collar, the large gold charm hanging from the front seems to be a stylized emblem of a ship's anchor merged with a microphone. The pair seem to be discussing the recent actions and punishment of the reality show slave Slooty.
		<br><br>Jules seems to be quite passionate about the subject, the animated way she talks is causing her sizable tits to bounce all over the place. "It doesn't matter how famous or valuable that slut thinks she is, her behavior was just wrong on SO many levels. It makes all of us good slaves look bad. If you ask me, her master's choice of punishment fits the attention whore perfectly!"
		<br><br>Kirk's face looks more than a little surprised, but you can't quite tell if it's an act or not. "You won't get any argument from me that she deserves to be punished... but getting chained up with an obedience collar and feeder system in the middle of Times Square, free for public use? A slum like Manhattan, she'll never <<if $seeExtreme == 0>><i>like</i><<else>>survive<</if>> the 10 day sentence!"
		<br><br>Jules smiles. "That's exactly right Master McMahon, she's going to be <<if $seeExtreme == 0>><i>hugged until she smiles</i><<else>>fucked to death<</if>>. Her precious popularity in the old world will have the locals lined up all the way to New New Jersey waiting for their turn. I'd never question her master's decision, but if it were me, I'd pump her full of curatives and stimulants during the sentence. That way, she doesn't <<if $seeExtreme == 0>><i>smile</i><<else>>die or pass out<</if>> too soon. I think her master is being lenient after the way she badmouthed him in a live broadcast."
		<br><br>...
	<<elseif $randShow == 2 && $showOne > 3 || $showOne == 2>>
		The program is showing some poorly-shot video showing a woman with flaming-red short hair angrily shouting at a large but uncomfortable-looking man. The title text at the bottom says: <b>"EmancipationGate: Emancipation Movement Exposed"</b> The video continues, revealing more of the angry woman. She's short, wearing a sweaty tanktop that makes her bushy underarm hair stand out. Based on the audio thus far, it seems she's trying to tell the large man to keep <<if $seeExtreme == 0>><i>hugging their captives until they smile</i><<else>>torturing their captives until they die<</if>>, that it has to be convincing for the camera. The man says he isn't comfortable doing that to kids, but the woman shouts him down by saying they're only migrant man brats before beginning some nonsensical babble about patriarchy and slavery. The video seems to be being shot on a small handheld device, and pans over to reveal a bunch of severely <<if $seeExtreme == 0>><i>hugged</i><<else>>beaten<</if>> children in slave chains that look like obvious S&M props to your well-trained eye. The angry woman's rant is still continuing from the background, but suddenly stops to be replaced with a yell: <i>"Get the fuck away from the subjects, you better not be fucking filming any..."</i> and the video cuts out.
		<br><br>
		The segment cuts back to two news anchors, a dark-haired man with a mustache and an aging bottle blonde. 
		<br><br>The bottle blonde speaks to the viewers. "Some of you may recognize the woman in that video as Angry Red, noted femsupremicist and a leading figure in the Old World Emancipation Movement. The video you saw was released along with countless other media files and documents from the movement in the EmancipationGate hacktivist attack. This particular video has been confirmed by computer analysis to be behind the scenes footage from the movement's latest documentary about the horrors of slavery."
		<br><br>The mustached man looks knowingly at the camera. "Anyone remotely familiar with Free City slavery knew the documentary was complete bullshit, but what we didn't know was just how far those radicalists were willing to go to make us all look bad."
		<br><br>...
	<<elseif $randShow == 3 && $showOne > 3 || $showOne == 3>>
		The segment seems to be more of a conversational piece. The two hosts are sitting next to each other on one couch. Samuel Klein, a handsome man with dark blonde hair and a winning smile, can't help but be overshadowed by his cohost. The popular SlaveAnchor Jules might be mistaken for just another gorgeous face and body, but it's her brilliant wit and sure-footed advocacy that made her famous. She's wearing her usual slave anchor collar, and her large natural breasts are only covered by the standard FCNN pasties, leaving the perky flesh free to jiggle enticingly. On this show her lower half is revealed; it's usually hidden behind a desk. The dark red material of her narrow panties matches her auburn hair, and reveals her broad hips and long slender legs.
		<br><br>The camera cuts back to two distinguished looking gentlemen, one is labeled by the screen as medical researchers. <<if $PC.medicine == 100>>You vaguely recognize both of them from your time studying medicine. <</if>>One of them continues the conversation, apparently answering a question. <i>"That's right, the results of our research tell us what everyone already suspected, but now with an indisputable weight of evidence behind it."</i> The other nods and continues, <i>"our meta analysis examines over two decades of data, and nearly 6000 independant studies. We can safely say that free city slaves are healthier than the average person living anywhere in the old world. While a few of the wealthiest countries of the old world may surpass one or two areas, our slaves have better nutrition, standard of living, are more psychologically stable, have longer lives, and are happier on average as well."</i> The first gentleman interjects, <i>"We even found strong evidence that the higher sexual tempo and libido-stimulating training given to sex slaves greatly contributes to their life span; they live even longer than the average slave, and even look younger than their age."</i>
		<br><br>The camera switches back to the two anchors, showing an excited Jules hefting and bouncing her tits. "They've barely sagged at all since they stopped growing, now I know why!"
		<br><br>As the AnchorSlave continues to squeeze, one of the researchers answers from off camera. <i>"That's right, it can be rather amazing. To tell you the truth, we didn't believe it at first, but the evidence made it too hard to ignore."</i> Jules starts looking toward the backstage area trying to signal someone as the other researcher continues. <i>"It's also important not to wear a bra unless you're doing high-impact cardio. We've known since the mid 20th century that wearing bras causes sagging; bras devastate the breasts of post-partem women in particular, and promote breast cancer... Despite countless decades-long studies showing us this, the old world insists on forcing women to wear..."</i>
		<br><br>It seems that Jules finally got the approval she was looking for, because she immediately reached down between her legs, causing the researcher to distractedly forget what he was saying. Apparently the panties she's wearing are of the dildo variety, because when she removes her hand you can see a tell-tale green indicator light glowing on the front of them. A cute rosey flush comes to Jules cheeks before she appologizes and urges the pair of researchers to continue.

	It looks like the random function chose to play the 'Home and Slave' stream channel. The current show features a set of female twins wearing nothing but tool belts. Their assets aren't particularly noteworthy, but they have a great hourglass figure, toned muscles, and gorgeous girl-next-door faces. The girls are hosting a DIY show, and seem to be performing a lot of the work themselves. The occassional bead of sweat makes their smooth tan skin really stand out. It seems like this time they are 
	<<if $randShow == 1>>
		working on modifications to an apartment to accommodate enormous anatomy. The pair demonstrate how to tastefully modify a doorway so that giant breasts, <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>smiles</i><<else>>testicles<</if>>, and baby bumps can get through easily. Their final results weren't refined enough to use in your own home, but were pretty amazing for the economy-sized apartment they filmed at.
		<br><br>At the end of the show they tested out the new doorways by bringing in a somewhat unusual slave. A naked fu<<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>n</i><</if>>tanari wearing only a cowbell collar, she had massive milky tits, gigantic <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>smile</i><<else>>balls hanging low in her sack<</if>>, and a belly engorged with what was probably a <<if $seeHyperPreg == 0>><i>single baby</i><<else>>dozen babies<</if>>. The <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>fun</i><<else>>futa<</if>> cow ambled through the modified door without a problem, resulting in a bouncy victory dance from the naked twins.

		working on setting up a slave nutrition system inside a moderately-sized apartment. They're installing a deluxe system that has integrated nutritional sensing in addition to a food system that supplies the unit's two feeder/med-dispenser combo units. Amazingly, the whole thing fits into the kitchen without a problem, they located the main system housing in the pantry. When they're finished, you couldn't tell the nutrition system is there, except for the two large dildos that are sticking out of the side of a cabinet. 
		<br><br>After their work is done, you're treated to watching the young twins testing the system out. They each take one feeder and ride it to get a test suppository, before turning around and inhaling the cockfeeders for a small meal. You wonder at their choice for the order of events, sucking the cockfeeder they had just finished ramming up their ass, but they were so enthusiastic about it that you decide they probably liked it that way.

		converting a bedroom into slave quarters. Rather than a complex or large project, this episode showcases a number of small projects. It's a pretty helpful show; a lot of what the nude twins cover will help owners house extra slaves without needing more space. The most interesting parts of the program to you were the slave training and libido upgrades they installed.
		<br><br>The room was set up so that slaves sleep in something resembling bunk beds, though there were 4 beds instead of 2. Instead of worrying about the lack of space, the twins used the confined sleeping arrangements as an advantage. A simple neural activity monitor combined with a few sources of stimulation or discomfort would serve to condition the slaves while they sleep. The twins helpfully demonstrated for their audience the features of these beds. Part of the stain-proof mattress is covered with flexible strips of metal to conduct electricity for stimulation or pain. Focused speakers would play naughty sounds, while a dim display can show a stream of pornography or other material without being bright enough to disturb the slave's sleep. The final addition was a quartet of vibrating waldos that extend from the bunk above to stimulate a slave while they sleep.
		<br><br>The whole setup seemed impressive, but you aren't really sure how effective it would be... particularly when you compare the likely cost of such a setup to an inexpensive cot on the floor.

	It looks like the random function chose to play the 'Home Slave Shopping' stream channel. It's a bit strange, shopping for slaves without inspecting them in person, but you have to admit it's kind of convenient. Plus, you might find something that'd be difficult to get in your own arcology's markets. You started watching at the end of one slave being displayed, the program was going into a lot of detail that isn't always available from shady salesmen at the market.

	It looks like the random function chose to play an episode of the slave-breeding for beginners series: 'Husbandry with Millie'. The show is hosted by the famous and charismatic Millie, a slave breeder from Arturus who appears to be in her mid thirties. She's wearing something resembling a maternity dress over her large pregnant belly, but the loose fabric doesn't hide her enormous hips and complementary ass. The dress only comes part of the way up her chest, leaving her large milk-engorged breasts exposed as they rest atop the fabric. Millie begins the show the same way as always, by giving her viewers some encouragement. "Anyone can become a breeder, even you! Just be willing to learn, and as I always say..." she pats her full belly meaninfully "be ready to get your hands dirty!"
	<br><br>
	<<set $randShow to random(2)+1>>
	<<if $randShow == 1 && $showFive > 3 || $showFive == 1>>
		Millie walks away from the classroom-like set, followed by a camera panning along beside her. Her purposeful steps and swinging hips set her breasts jiggling, and sending droplets of milk flying from her dark milky nipples. It takes a sadly brief time for her to arrive at her destination, a mostly-white clinical-looking set prepared with several naked--and presumably fertile--slaves. As she comes to a stop in front of the line of slaves, all of the beautiful girls bow their heads and greet her. "<i>Hello Mistress Millie!</i>" 
		<br><br>
		Millie ignores the naked slaves and turns to the camera. "Today we're going to cover the basics of choosing good breeding sluts, using some of my own stock. Of course, as we covered before, you want to choose breeders that have the traits you're looking for. Intelligence, temperment, bone structure, beauty, or simple cosmetic features like skin and hair color. But that's not all you need to look for!" Millie beckens to one of the slaves in the background, who rushes forward to stand in front of the camera. She points at the girl's flank, and the camera zooms in so that the screen is taken up by the girl's broad hips and moist pussy. "They call them child-bearing hips for a reason!" Millie starts rubbing the girl's hips as she continues. "Wide hips are a solid indicator of a good breeder; they mean a healthier pregnancy and easier--not to mention cheaper--birth. And if you want to increase your production with multiple pregnancies, wide hips are a must!"
		<br><br>
		The wide hips of the nubile slave girl suddenly walk off camera, and are soon replaced by the hips of another girl that are dramatically smaller. They aren't the hips of a man, but certainly bring to mind the narrow hips of an old-timey fashion model. The girl has a little extra weight, which is more obvious on her narrow frame, but you can tell she is fit with well-developed muscles. Millie starts touching her demonstration model as she points things out. "Sometimes, you're looking for narrow hips. Maybe you want to breed an athlete or pit fighter, or your tastes just run that way for some reason. You don't have to rule out a slut just because she has small hips, but there are some things to look for. First, you want to make sure the bitch is nicely plush, with well-distributed fat. This is important for a healthy pregnancy, but tends to be overlooked in narrow sluts. Also check their core strength. Muscles are even more important for narrow sluts, to help support the uterus and ease childbirth." She traces the shapes of the slave's hips. "They might be small, but make sure they're well formed, you want them to work properly. Finally, check the pubic bone, it's joints with the illiac crests, and the fore part of the crests. You want a smooth curve throughout with loose joints that'll open wide n' easy when it's time." 
		<br><br>
		With a smack on the ass, the bitch trots off camera to be replaced by a girl with her knees bent and feet spaced far apart. When the camera pans down you have a clear view of her sodden slit; the stage lights give the natural lubricant coating her inner thighs a more noticeable sheen. Millie rubs two fingers between the slaves' labia, and withdrawls the now-soaked digits for the camera to see. "Remember! A wet cunt is a good cunt!" Without any warm-up, she bunches her fingers and thumbs together and inserts her entire hand into the slave's gaping pussy. "A loose baggy cunt may be no good for fucking, but I guarantee it's perfect for making you new slaves. And it may just help you save money, too. Loose cunts tend to drive down a slut's value, right at the perfect age for turning a slut into a breeding bitch."
		<br><br>.....
	<<elseif $randShow == 2 && $showFive > 3 || $showFive == 2>>
		Millie walks towards the back of the set, returning with her hands behind her back. "This episode, we're going to talk about an important decision any breeder needs to make. Bull" she pulls a large life-like <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>pop sickle</i><<else>>dildo<</if>> from behind her back, "or no bull?" This time she whips out something resembling a turkey baster. She gives both a hard squeeze, and they both squirt out a jet of <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>whipped cream.</i><<else>>alabaster fluid.<</if>> She drops both of the spent tools and turns to walk towards her chair, the camera follows to give a good view of hefty ass and swinging hips.
		<br><br>
		Sitting down in her comfortable-looking chair, Millie begins her lecture. "So, thanks to the miracles of the modern dairy and industrial <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>banana</i><<else>>cock<</if>> milkers, a reliable supply of <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>banana juice</i><<else>>cum<</if>> is available for most citizens. This is definitely the least expensive option for those starting out, and combined with easy access, seems to be a popular choice for new breeders. It's also a common pitfall, so thank goodness you're watching now! Industrial dairies simply aren't focused on reproduction in most arcologies. Owners are focused on production, quantity over quality, and most of the material is used for slave nutrition and industrial purposes. Even if your arcology has a reproduction-focused <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>banana cream</i><<else>>jizz<</if>> farm, they're usually focused on breeding menials. You still have no way of knowing what you're getting. It makes any attempt at proper husbandry nearly impossible. You don't want to sink all your resources into buying and caring for breeding sluts, only to end up with a litter only fit to be menials!"
		<br><br>
		Your best bet if you're low on resources is looking to prominant citizens with high quality slaves. Often times, for a modest stud fee, you can get your bitches pregnant with a known stud of high quality. Particularly when it comes to older bulls, you can often get your bitches bred for nearly the same cost as dairy <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>cream</i><<else>>jizz<</if>>! You do have to do the leg work, but think of it as picking the best bull for your breeding plan. As you get more established, purchase an older bull for yourself. Older bulls are better-behaved, and still perfectly capable of helping to take care of your pregnant sluts, when they aren't knocking up the empty ones, that is. A slave may be old, but the DNA in that <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>banana juice</i><<else>>cum<</if>> is the same as it was 20 years ago!"
		<br><br>
		Millie gives the viewers a big smile. "If you take anything away from this episode, just remember that industrial <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>juice</i><<else>>cum<</if>> is used to make industrial slaves!"
		<br><br>.....
	<<else>>
		Millie walks towards the camera, approaching it at an angle, and giving the viewers a good look at her dripping tits. The camera pans while leaving part of Millie in-frame, revealing a naked slave on display. The slave is the perfect picture of a breeding bitch: gargantuan hips, toned muscles, plush softness, and a pair of milk-filled tits. Millie sounds happy as she explains her first display. "So we've covered what makes the perfect birthing slut, this one here gave birth just a few weeks ago." Millie's upper body takes up a quarter of the camera frame, and she provides some bouncy entertainment as the camera pans to the next display. It's a <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>very happy</i><<else>>well-hung<</if>> bull with <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>large horns.</i><<else>>huge balls that look swollen with seed.<</if>>
		<br><br>
		Millie stops to inspect the display, taking a moment to <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>pat the happy bull's fur.</i><<else>>taste test the dropplet of pre hanging from its semi-erect cock.<</if>> "You know how to pick a good bull too." She snaps her fingers, and the slave from earlier trots into view. The fertile slave gets down on all fours with her legs spread wide, and points her dripping snatch at the waiting bull <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>to let it know that she isn't a threat.</i><<else>>to intice it into a good fucking and insemination.<</if>> Millie continues, "And of course, you know how to bring the two together to get your bitches good and bred. <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>The bull snorts contentedly, and lets out a short "moo!"</i><<else>>The bull's cock quickly swells to full mast, and with a nod from Millie he positions himself on his knees behind the sow and mounts her.<</if>> As the two slaves behind her <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>laugh and play</i><<else>>fuck like rabbits<</if>>, Millie contines. "We've covered all this, but you're probably dying to know: 'what comes after?'"
		<br><br>
		Millie walks once more, moving away from the moaning slaves until a beautiful slave nursing two babies and an odd looking machine come into view. "If you live somewhere that supports it, you could always sell the litter... you won't make much though. All the care that went into creating a high-quality litter will likely be wasted. Of course, you could always keep the litter, let the slaves raise em until they're old enough to be trained." Millie rubs the thin hair of one of the suckling infants. "That's the traditional way. There's good money in it if you're successful, but it's a sizeable investment of time and money to get to the first sale. If you've kept up the breeding and have room, you'll finally be able to sell a new batch of slaves each year, and of course keep some for breeding." Millie gives the slave's hip and ass a quick caress. "This one here's a second generation breeding slut, she's already given me several healthy litters."
		<br><br>
		Millie faces the camera. "But what if you want to do some serious breeding? Maybe you want a litter that'll grow to have gigantic natural tits with rich milk that just pours out of the nipple, or maybe you want a litter with hips so wide that they can fit a head between their legs without opening them? The trouble is time..." Millie looks sad for a moment. "Slaves take too long to reach maturity; even if you start breeding em young, how many decades will it be before you reach that perfect third or fourth generation?" She walks over to the machine and pats it lovingly. "Thanks to this beauty of modern science, we can accellerate the growth of your most promising calf. Instead of waiting <<if $pedo_mode == 0>>18 years<<else>>$minimumSlaveAge years<</if>> to breed em, you can have them ready to go in <<if $pedo_mode == 0>>only 3.<<else>>as little as a year.<</if>> Fact is, the newer models can have a sow ready to be bred in half a year, and give em some training and conditioning on the way. I've even heard rumors that the most cutting-edge tech will do it in 3 months."
		<br><br>
		"You may be thinking: 'as if I could ever afford something like that!'" Millie gives the camera a bright smile. "Don't worry, Mamma Millie's got you covered. It's true that most've you won't be able to afford one of these, not to mention the special electrical hookups and maintenance... but the fact that better models exist means that the older models don't have much use for the types of people that <b>can</b> afford them. That means empty incubators that are just too valuable to simply dispose of, and a chance for you to rent or lease one or two of em long enough to get a major jump start on your breeding program. It'll still be expensive, maybe even as much as a high-quality slave ready to be trained. You'll also have to deal with and treat the chemical damage. But when it comes to developing a solid breeding line to produce high quality litters, the time savings can't be beat. Just don't expect the ones fresh out of the incubator to be good for much other that making new slaves!"

	It looks like the random function chose to play an episode of the 'Modern Dairy' edutainment series, which opens with a montage of milk-related food and cooking shots. After the last of the opening credits disappears, the show sticks to a single shot from the montage, a delicious looking bowl of cereal. The camera zooms out to reveal the show's host wearing her trademark cow print leotard, and getting just a little too much enjoyment out of her cereal. She slowly puts the spoon down while savoring her cereal, reluctantly swallowing and starting the show. "Hi there y'all, welcome to another episode of Modern Dairy!" She gives the camera a wave--setting her gargantuan melons wobbling inside the spandex-like leotard--and the camera fades to black.

		The camera fades in to show an excited Bess standing next to a double door labeled 'Dairy 3'. "I'm here at Arcology G-9 to give you a look at their state-of-the-art milking equipment." Bess gestures to her jiggling bosom. "As you can see, I'm terribly excited! I've heard this dairy's equipment is a pretty radical departure from the standard ones that look like dentist's chairs!" Without further ado, she pushes her way through the swinging doors, and sets off into the dairy. The camera follows, spending as much time focused on her seductively-swinging rear end as it does panning to look around the long room. The first thing you notice is that the lighting is a soft warm glow more at home in a spa than an industrial facility. The room consists of a long hallway, the row of milkers on either side are separated by fabric dividing curtains in earthtone colors, though most of them appear to be open. You didn't notice at first, but it seems like most of the milkers are occupied... the radically different shape tricked your trained eye for a moment.
		<br><br>
		Eventually Bess reaches the end of the hallway, and is greeted by a nearly-naked slave with visible muscles that seems to be a milk maid. <i>"Hello there Ma'am, you must be Bess. My name is Anabell, and I'm a milk maid here. Welcome to dairy number three!"</i>
		<br><br>
		Bess is distracted my the milk maid's <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>greeting</i><<else>>dangling cock, even soft it looks massive<</if>>, but manages to shake the proffered hand. "Thanks for having me!" She gestures widely to the room. "What's with the lights and... umm... decor?"
		<br><br>
		The milk maid smiles. <i>"A happy cow is a productive cow, Ma'am. The cows spend lots of time here, and Master says 'a pleasant and relaxing environment makes a big difference in their production.' Master says that it's an investment to make the cows feel like they're in a fancy spa, but that it's so cheap it pays for itself in extra milk lickity-split."</i>
		<br><br>
		Bess looks impressed. "You've got a pretty smart master! Seems like he takes good care of the cows, too!"
		<br><br>
		The milk maid gives an emphatic nod. <i>"My Master's daddy, and his daddy's daddy were dairy farmers, so he knows what he's doin. Master said that lots of folks think slaves don't deserve any care or fancy treatment, that slaves are animals an you can't give em anything without putting ideas in their heads. Master said those folks are right we don't </i>deserve<i> anything, but that otherwise those folks just don't know jack shit about raising livestock."</i>
		Bess smiles. "I guess G-9 isn't at the top of the quality and quantity charts by accident!" She moves over toward one of the occupied milkers to take a better look. Rather than a chair, it's set up almost like a massage table, and the slave is lying face down on the table's comfortable padding. The chest area of the table is almost completely missing, allowing the cow's 15,000 CC udders to hang downward. Rather than hang painfully, however, they're well supported by some kind of strong fabric that looks soft but stretchy. Their supported shape seems ideal for milking, opening up the milk ducts and letting gravity drain the milk toward the exposed nipples. A clear cup is attached to each teat, rich milk flooding rhythmically down wide tubes to be collected in a massive intermediary reservoir. Bess turns back to the milk maid. "So I think I understand what the setup in the front is for, but what's all this going on in the back?"
		<br><br>
		Anabell walks up to the milking table, and gestures to the lower half. <i>"Ma'am, is it okay if I answer one part at a time?"</i> Bess gives a cheerful nod, so Anabell points to the cow's abdomen. <i>"I know it's hard to see cause of that metal holdin up the table, but there's actually an adjustable belly support there."</i> the dairy slave gives the cow an affectionate rub on one butt cheek. <i>"She may not look it right now, but this one here is more'n seven months pregnant with triplets. The table supports the womb, taking the weight and pressure off the cow. All the cows say it's the most comfortable place to be when they're full of calf!"</i> Smiling, Anabell points down between the cow's legs. The camera moves closer to get a good look, and the microphone starts picking up traces of audio from whatever program the cow's watching. Once the camera is positioned at the feet, you can see between her slightly-spread legs that there's a large adjustable-looking opening under her pubic region. More facinating though, is the device attached to her groin; it looks really similar to an athletic cup. It's just a bit bigger and longer with some tubes and a wire coming out of it, and hides the cow's vulva and asshole from the camera.
		<br><br>
		With a questioning look, Anabell asks Bess <i>"Ma'am, I figure you already know what the hole's for, but should I explain it for the camera?"</i> Bess simply smiles and nods, indicating that the milk maid should continue. <i>"Well all of you watching probably already guessed one reason for the hole there: it lets the tubes and such through nice and neat so we don't have to worry about em getting pinched or kinked. The other reason for the hole is that plenty of cows have <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>sensitive legs.</i><<else>>big ol balls that need milked too.<</if>> There's an attachment there for a stretch mesh just like what we use for the udders, it supports em nice and comfortable. There's even a motor in the table there, moves the mesh to roll em around a bit and keep em producing."</i> Anabell points toward the groin device. <i>"We call this miracle gadget here a 'cup'... cause it looks like one, right?"</i> Both Beth and Anabell give a chuckle at the rather flat joke. <i>"Probably the best way to explain it'd be to take it out, would you like to see?"</i>
		<br><br>
		Bess gives an excited nod, "yes, that'd be great!"
		<br><br>
		Anabell taps out a practiced rhythm on the cow's ass cheeks, <i>"we wouldn't wanna startle our cow here, so we have signals."</i> The cow shifts her weight slightly to open her thighs more and tilt her hips slightly upward. With a practiced hand, the milk maid reaches in and pulls on the cup. Her arm obstructs the view, but you hear a slight hissing noise. It's only a moment before Anabell is showing the business side of the cup to the camera, revealing the cow's surprisingly wet cunt and gaped vagina along with a loose pink asshole. <i>"So I suppose I'll start with the top here... So this butt plug here is pretty much a butt plug, though it's not meant to stretch a cow out. It helps hold everything in place, so the cup can stay in place without much suction, too much suction for too long is pretty bad for a cow and her unborn calves. At the tip you can see it looks a bit different than a normal butt plug; there's an opening that can feed in meds and liquids to keep em hydrated and healthy. There's also a gas diff.. diss... sorry, a gas diffusion membrane that lets out any pressure for practical reasons. The cup here also collects it though, something about methane and not wasting anything. This yellow tube here is where the gas goes."</i>
		<br><br>
		Anabell points at the large and vaguely mechanical looking dildo. <i>"Below the butt plug is the pussy plug. It does a whole bunch of things. Of course it helps stimulate the cow to improve production, but it also collects the cow's lubricant. As a cow gets closer to birth it stretches her out real good, and gets her hips ready to open nice and wide, so that the calves come out real easy. After eight months, we swap it out for one with a cervix massager."</i> Pointing to the nubby bottom area of the cup, she continues. <i>"Down here there are all these mechanical nubs that move around and vibrate, they keep a cow nice and stimulated. You can't really see it, but this is also where it collects the cow's pee for recycling. It wastes too much time for cows to be comin and goin to the toilet, but it'd a stinky mess if the cows just peed on the floor. With this, it's real easy for a cow to stay here all day. Maybe <i>too</i> easy, sometimes we hafta kick em out for breaks and exercise!"</i>
		<br><br>
		Next Anabell points out how the table is split in two from the feet all the way up to the groin hole. <i>"That probably looks strange, right? Easiest way to explain it would be to show you."</i> She does something to the table out of view, and stands back. The two sections of table, each one holding a leg, start moving apart to spread the cow's legs. They stop when her legs are spread at a 45 degree angle, incidentally giving the camera a great view of the cow's pussy. <i>"So it's real useful sometimes to have a cow's legs open like this, and it's also good to help stretch her hips. Next is the real magic though!"</i> He reaches forward and touches the table again. This time though, the table's movements are a lot more complex. It bends her knees and waist, while tilting her ass upward and spreading her legs further. By the time it's done her body looks like it's ready for doggy style, with her thighs spread too wide to be practical for a bed, and the cow's hips and legs angled in such a way that her large ass is completely out of the way of her spread cunt. <i>"ah, Ma'am, if it's okay, it'd be really mean to put the table back without finishing first..."</i>
		<br><br>
		Bess looks a little bit envious of the cow, but gives her approval. "Go ahead, I'll just help myself to some fresh milk while you're busy." She heads toward the dangling udders to retrieve her treat. It only takes Anabell a few shakes <<if $seeDicks == 0>><i>of the massage oil bottle before the cow's ass is glistening, and he gets to work massaging her.</i><<else>>to get her monstrous python of a cock throbbing and ready, and she doesn't waste any time hilting herself in the cow's ready pussy.<</if>> There's a loud muffled moo, and the camera reluctantly moves to get a shot of Bess.
		<br><br>
		Bess is on her hands and knees, her mouth full of nipple and milk, messily trying to keep up with the output of the prodigious mammary. She pinches the nipple to stop drinking for a moment so that she can speak to the camera. "Oh my god! This milk is SOOO good!" She sucks the cow's long nipple back into her mouth and resumes her feast.

		This episode seems to be focusing on some basics in addition to an archology's Penthouse.
		<br><br>
		A standard arcology is so huge that it needs to be divided into levels and sectors to make talking about it easier. Levels are the horizontal rows. An arcology is a very large building, and each Level includes many floors. Sectors are slices of those levels. For example, on Levels with four Sectors, each sector includes a quarter of each floor that's part of that Level. Each Sector is typically occupied by facilities, tenants, or both. Sometimes facilities are owned or leased by tenants! Now when your friend tells you to meet them at "prominade B" or mentions that they live in sector "7C", you'll know how those names came about.
		<br><br>
		In most arcologies with a single owner, the uppermost Level is called the Penthouse. It's an entire sector where the owner and slaves under his direct supervision live. With such a large space for a single person or family, there is a great deal of customization possible. Even two arcologies of the same design, built at the same time, are likely to have very different penthouses! It's always worth visiting a penthouse if you get the chance. Not all arcologies are built or owned by a single person, often there is a group or partnership of owners. After all, building a structure as massive as an arcology is an extremely expensive endevour! In these cases, the term penthouse is typically still used to refer to the top sector, as it is often divided into a number of luxurious penthouse apartments for the owners.
	<<elseif $randShow == 2 && $showSeven > 3 || $showSeven == 2>>
		This episode seems to be focusing on the Promenade and residential areas.
		<br><br>
		Below the penthouse--and potentially some residential sectors--is the Promenade, which is a major social area and hosts most of the businesses which cater to the arcology's citizens. Promenade Sectors are occupied by shops, restaurants, and other amusements. A promenade is critical to the success of an arcology; it allows the arcology to function as a self-contained residence, and is important to the economy. Sometimes it's nice to head over to a different arcology in your Free City for some unique cuisine or shopping, but could you imagine having to go through all that trouble any time you wanted to shop or eat out? While the concept of a promenade is almost universal amongst arcologies, the design, layout, and decoration of each tends to be rather unique, making it a fun experience to visit the promenade of arcologies other than your own.
		<br><br>
		The next area common to all arcologies are the residential sectors filled with apartments and other living arrangements. While designs and layouts differ--some arcologies have luxury residential areas that resemble an old-fashioned neighborhood complete with artificial sky--the purpose is always to house arcology citizens. Residential areas are critical for an arcology, in order to have a functioning self-contained economy. While all citizens in an arcology are fortunate, some are more fortunate than others. Lower-class citizens commonly live in dense efficiency apartments, while wealthy citizens often live in oppulent sectors with large apartments. Without citizens there would be nobody to own or operate the stores, restaurants, and other attractions in the arcology, and there would be nobody to purchase those goods or services either!
	<<elseif $randShow == 3 && $showSeven > 3 || $showSeven == 3>>
		This episode seems to be focusing on the lower levels, the Concourse and Service Level.
		<br><br>
		Another common level for an arcology is the Concourse, which is typically located near the bottom of the structure. Like the Promenade, it hosts businesses, but these focus less on the luxury and entertainment needs of citizens than the Promenade. The Concourse typically houses bulk trade, necessary services such as medical clinics, corporate offices, research and development centers, and even education facilities. The best universities in the world are located on the concourse level of an arcology! Of course, the concourse also houses slave markets and slave training facilities. Some arcologies have arenas for sports or other events, while others have venues for sport combat ranging from traditional octagon fighting rings to pits remenescant of ancient gladitorial combat. If you're lucky, your arcology may just have a public arcade, where a variety of needs can be met at an affordable price. With research pointing to the benefits of arcades to adolescent development, family-friendly arcologies are quickly adding arcades of their own!
		<br><br>
		The lowest and largest level is typically known as the Service level. Its Sectors are occupied by manufacturing and industry, including the production of food resources such as livestock facilities and dairies. Menial slaves are housed in the Service level, and often work there too. The service level also contains much of an arcology's infrastructure, supplying clean water and electricity to the citizens and businesses. Another common sight in the service level is that of a warehouse, which stores the goods and raw materials an arcology needs, and also facilitates trade with other arcologies. Finally, the Service level may contain barracks and training facilities for mercenaries or arcology militia tasked to protect it from the Old World.

		a documentary on the surging Repopulation movement: "Continuing the Dream". After the opening credits, the documentary introduces a young and extremely pregnant woman as the commentator. The program makes an impassioned argument about the need for a new generation of citizens and slaves that were born into the dream of the free cities. The woman is wearing semi-conservative business attire, and has on elegant makeup. She looks somewhat plain when compared to the hyper-sexualized style of other FCTV programming, though she does make it plain over the course of the program that she loves sex more than ever. She tends to use herself as an example to show that pregnancy no longer means limitations or sacrifice, instead emphasizing that she's on her fifth pregnancy and would rather be with child than without. 
		<br><br>The woman makes two main points during the course of the documentary. The first is that the combined population of the free cities needs to grow explosively for 'Free City Society' to become stable. She points out several economic reasons, including the drive to invest in research and infrastructure. She has interviews with experts explaining the need for independance; that the Free Cities are still dependent on the Old World industrially and financially, and that the population must expand dramatically to avoid going down with the metaphorical ship. The more Free Cities there are, the more they become free and independent of the Old World.
		<br><br>The second point concerns the source of the new citizens and slaves that the Free Cities need. Her arguments concerning citizens focus on the unique culture of the Free Cities, and the direction that the future society will take. She points out that immigrants from the Old World are rooted in its decaying culture. She asks her viewers how long it took them to adapt to their new lives, and how often they find themselves doubting their new home subconsciously. She admits that even she sometimes finds something wrong or repulsive, until she realizes that it's the ghost of her past life clinging to her. A noted psychologist talks about the strong hold people's earlier lives has on them, and how developing the promise of the Free Cities will need a generation untainted by the Old World. The documentary's argument for slaves largely comes down to the fact that second-generation slaves are happier, better adjusted, and simply better slaves. 
		<<if $IntelligenceEugenicsSMR != 0 || $HeightEugenicsSMR != 0 || $FaceEugenicsSMR != 0>>
			It also points out the practical problems that the mass importation of slaves will cause in the gene pool.

		a documentary on the increasingly-popular Gender Radicalist movement titled: "Power, not Biology". After the opening credits, the documentary introduces an androgynous documentarian in a nicely-cut suit. The finely tailored suit doesn't try to hide the person's breasts, which seem to be a pretty average D-cup. Similarly, another bulge is visible stretching down one of the pants legs. The futanari opens with a pretty simple question: "am I a man, or am I a woman?" The documentary is focused on answering that question in the context of a modern era where medical science means that genitalia are irrelevant. It argues that a person's body no longer has any relation to their sexuality or ambition, that being free means choosing the body that pleases you most, and that society needs a new criteria from which to determine gender.
		<br><br>The criteria suggested by the documentary is power. The idea is simple; the powerful are male, the weak are female. It argues that the biology and sexual proclivities of a person simply can't represent them any longer. The powerful are often free to choose the body and activities they wish to pursue, while the weak have those decisions made for them. It's a practical argument, and the documentary gives a long list of evidence supporting it, from expert interviews to ancient civilizations that followed a similar idea. The concept is somewhat appealing to you; after all, you wield extraordinary power, and a large part of that power includes altering the bodies of others. Whatever you choose to do, you can't see any reason to let your slaves and citizens criticize you for it.

		a documentary on conservative Gender Fundamentalism movement titled: "It's Eve, NOT Steve". After the outdated graphics finish displaying the garish opening credits, a portly man in late middle age introduces himself as Reverend Brad, the apparent commentator of the program. You don't pay much attention, but learn that apparently the Futanari Sisters are whore agents of Satan. You also learn that you're apparently destined for hell because of the medical technology in your penthouse that could be used to alter someone's naughty bits. You did get a good laugh when the reverend started yelling that choir boys are boys, and if he wanted a girl he would've found a nun.
		<br><br>You have to admit that most of the show is complete bullshit, but you can't deny that it's useful for controlling your citizens. As long as they're filling their heads with this bullshit, they won't be getting any dangerous ideas from somewhere else. In a more practical sense, it's a lot easier to manage an arcology and a house full of slaves when you don't have to worry about crazy gender issues or people disliking pregnant slaves.

		a documentary on the growing Asset Expansionist movement titled: "More of a Good Thing". After a brief set of opening credits the documentary dives immediately into short clips of numerous interviews with stacked women stating that they love having big tits and a big ass. Eventually, a man and woman are introduced as the hosts of the program. Both are finely dressed in the recent fashions, and despite the subject of the documentary, they don't have humongous assets. The woman does have huge breasts, wide hips, and a large derrier; the man has a noticeable bulge in his pants, but nothing extreme. The hosts explain that seeing Asset Expansionism as a call for ridiculous size is something of a misconception. They emphasize that it's about the freedom to enjoy more of a good thing.
		<br><br>The documentary makes several arguments in favor of the movement, and is clear about explaining the natural biological attraction humans have to large assets. By interviewing stacked members of the movement and psychological experts alike, they try to demonstrate how larger assets lead to happier and more pleasureable lives, both in and out of the bedroom. The documentary neatly tops off its argument by demonstrating how assets have been expanding naturally since the start of the twentieth century, and claiming that it's silly to idolize the way humans looked before modern nutrition and medicine. Western countries in the old world already had average bust sizes of D-cup or larger by the turn of the century, the hosts claim that trying to go back to smaller sizes is synonymous with reducing the prosperity of free citizens.

		a documentary on the Slimness Enthusiast counter movement titled: "Slim is In". Artistic opening credits play across the screen before a slim woman walks up and begins talking to the camera conversationally. She seems to be in her mid to late thirties, and is wearing conservative makeup to accent her natural beauty. Her narrow waist combines with her slim hips and full shoulders to create a balanced but muted hourglass profile. It's a look that was popular for decades on fashion models in the Old World, and it improves the attractiveness of her B or C cup breasts and taut butt. It's obvious that the woman aspires to be a role model in addition to being the documentary's commentator.
		<br><br>Much of the documentary's arguments center around the concept of fashion and the priviledged. They point out how in the past societal changes have altered what people find attractive, giving skin tans as an example. When most worked outside and only the priviledged stayed indoors pale skin was considered attractive. When the world changed and most people worked indoors, suddenly the tan skin of those with leisure time to spend outside came into vogue. She argues that modern hormones can easily expand the assets of the masses, but that only the priviledged can afford to sculpt themselves into an ideal form like hers. She points out that even though the masses may immitate with surgery, they'll never be able to copy the naturally good bone structure and vibrancy of the well-bred elite.

		a documentary on the spreading Body Purist movement titled: "Don't Settle for Immitations". The opening credits are displayed over a series of comparison images showing beautiful breasts and asses next to obviously artificial immitations of the same. The screen splits and shows the two hosts in their own environments side by side. One is an extremely attractive doctor, her body is exquisitely curvy underneath her lab coat and her face is an impossible combination of beautiful and cute. The other host is an artist with graying hair, he's working in his studio to create a lifesize scupture of the first host. He starts off the documentary by asking why people are so eager to destroy the natural beauty of the human form. The doctor continues by asking why people are so impatient that they get implants instead of using a supperior process of targeted hormonal growth.
		<br><br>The documentary keeps up the two-viewpoint style and approaches the issue from two directions. The first is the stark asthetic differences between natural and artificial bodies. It demonstrates why implants always fall short of the beauty they seek to immitate, and how those with implants are doomed to a viscious cycle of surgery to try and recapture the beauty they lost in the initial surgery. The other angle, presented by the doctor, is a lot more practical. It points out the numerous shortcomings of implants when compared to natural growth, such as the frequent need for maintenance surgeries, the significant extra health risks, the reduced pleasure and sensitivity felt by implant patients, and the extreme difficulty of a patient to get what they want. Taken together the argument is pretty simple: why get implants when other medical options are cheaper, safer, more effective, healthier, and more attractive?

		a documentary on the rise of the Transformation Fetish titled: "The Mass Insanity of Adding Mass". The opening credits are styled to look like a psychological case study from a mental institution. When the credits finish, the video cuts to a scene of a man sitting behind a desk, the whole shot is high contrast due to the harsh lighting from a lone desk lamp. The middle-aged man screams 'hard-boiled' and looks like he walked straight out of a noir film to host this documentary. His opening monologue makes it pretty clear that this documentary has a lot of parallels with a crime documentary. Worse, is that the evidence and expert witnesses available to the producers were apparently overwhelming, because the program seems rushed trying to fit as much as it can into a narrow time slot.
		<br><br>Evidence and whatever else be damned, this isn't the kind of documentary that should be on the FCTV stream in your arcology. You tell $assistantName to remind you to send a complaint in the morning.
