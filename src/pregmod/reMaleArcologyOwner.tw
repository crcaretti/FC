:: RE male arcology owner [nobr]
 


<<set $nextButton = "Continue", $nextLink = "RIE Eligibility Check">>

The more reputable you've gotten, the more rarefied your entertainments have become. Parties featuring celebrities, old world national leaders, and Free Cities arcology owners have become a nearly nightly experience for you, an expected part of your routine as one of the Free Cities' leading citizens. According to your whims and predilections, you have the choice of participating all night or just making a brief appearance at the start. The important thing is that they're here, come to pay tribute by their presence.
<br><br>
Tonight there are several attendees of such stature that you must exchange pleasantries with each. The last is a fellow arcology owner, not quite up to your stature of course, but certainly worth conciliating. As usual, it's a man. He stands a touch taller than you, and is wearing one of the best-tailored suits you've ever seen. The pants are cut perfectly to draw your eyes to his bulge, and, from what you can see, he is quite toned; the jacket is masculine, and accentuates his fine chest. He is obviously well into middle age, but has made no attempt to hide the fact, allowing his graying hair to proudly display his experience.
<br><br>
He strikes a fine balance in conversation with you, firm enough to not overpower you, yet neither aggressive nor insistent. He does not take too much of your time, but after you've moved on to your next prominent guest, you receive a brief private message from him. "Surely it's been a while since you've met someone who could make you feel like a woman," it reads. "I'm sure your slaves are fun enough, but letting one of them or some citizen be your man would be fatally stupid. I don't think anyone would look down on you for hooking up with me, though. No strings attached." You glance over at where he's standing. He's listening politely to a business proposition, and he turns his head slightly toward you, one corner of his firm mouth quirking upward.

<<link "Head over and assert yourself">>
	<<replace "#result">>
	You head over and insert yourself into the conversation between him and the woman trying to convince him to invest in her solar power concern. Your presence and power are such that she gives way rapidly, and you ostentatiously yet nonverbally assert your right to first claim to his company and conversation. After a few minutes of this public display, however, it becomes apparent that this is not what he was looking for. He is likely concerned that you are far too assertive for him to safely manage. He excuses herself and withdraws. You return to your <<if $PC.refreshmentType == 0>>$PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 1>>glass of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 2>>plate of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 3>>pouch of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 4>>syringe of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 5>>bottle of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 6>>sheet of $PC.refreshment<</if>>, consoling yourself that you are not exactly starved for company.

<br><<link "Walk past him and out onto an unoccupied balcony">>
	<<replace "#result">>
	You walk past him and out onto a balcony. He politely disengages himself and follows, meeting your gaze with a twinkle in his eye. You start talking of nothing of real consequence, but you find that you do have a fair amount to discuss and joke about, since there are oddities to your life that only another slaveowning arcology owner can really understand. You discover that he is very willing to share $PC.refreshment, and you break out some of your best. The party takes notice of your tete-a-tete, but his judgment was obviously correct. Rather than looking down on you, the other prominent guests seem respectfully envious of his access to you. This is still the case even when he starts to get flirty, leaning into you, brushing against you, and more. <<if $assistantName is "your personal assistant">>Your personal assistant<<else>>$assistantName<</if>> cleared your suite long ago, so when he finally nudges his hip against yours and does not take it away, you take him by the hand and lead him there. He stops you with a hand at the door to the suite and unbuttons his shirt, revealing a triathlete's tanned and sculpted body. As you begin to strip, he embraces you, whispering, "You have no idea how nice this is." It's clear it's been a long time since you've let someone else take the lead, and he sometimes has to snap wrestle you for dominance. He leaves a few hours later with a satisfied expression, giving you a deep kiss on his way out in full public view. @@.green;Your reputation has greatly improved.@@

<br><<link "Quickly arrange an anonymous night out for him">>
	<<replace "#result">>
	You immediately enlist $assistantName to help you make some hasty preparations, and then send him a message asking him if he'd like to spend a night out with you, as a couple of unremarkable citizens. He glances at you with a curious expression, and you direct him to a side room. He finds you there, changing into the heavy, anonymizing armor of one of your mercenaries; you have a male suit for him, too. Once you're both suited up, you move to show him how to activate the face-obscuring helmet, but you find that he's already got it on and active. "This," he says, "is either the best or the stupidest date idea I have ever heard. Let's fucking do this." You pass a mercenary on your way out onto the club, and he cannot resist giving you a thumbs up, which your fellow arcology owner fortunately fails to notice. You patrol for a while, using internal comms to joke about life as an arcology owner, something he clearly gets to do too infrequently. You don't mind the chance, either. Your mercenaries frequently spend time together off duty, so nobody sees anything unusual about a male and female in mercenary armor sharing a milkshake at a dairy bar, even when they start to engage in increasingly rough public flirting, armor and all. Later, your slaves are obliged to pick up and sort a trail of discarded armor pieces leading from the entry to your penthouse all the way to your suite, which is now emitting the indistinct sounds of very energetic sex. A few hours later, when you're showering up together so he can head back to his domain, he looks at you and says seriously, "That was pretty fun. If things ever go to shit, I wouldn't mind wearing that armor for real." Your mercenaries cannot keep their mouths shut, for once, and the almost unbelievably juicy story of the arcology owners wearing borrowed armor to go on an anonymous date spreads like wildfire. @@.green;Your reputation has greatly improved.@@
