:: Elective Surgery [nobr]

You arrive at your favorite plastic surgeon for your appointment to find them as busy as ever. She wastes no time in hurrying in into their office, stripping you down, measuring you and making sure you are healthy enough for surgery, all the while not so subtly running her hands across every part of you. "So, what can I help you with?"

<br>"Maybe some breast work? I assure you they are lovely." She says as she brushes the back of your head with her own pair. "5000造 for a reduction, 10000造 for implants, that includes size ups, and 15000造 for additional breast tissue. That last one might as well be real!"<br>
