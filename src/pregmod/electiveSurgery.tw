:: Elective Surgery [nobr]

You arrive at your favorite plastic surgeon for your appointment to find them as busy as ever. She wastes no time in hurrying in into their office, stripping you down, measuring you and making sure you are healthy enough for surgery, all the while not so subtly running her hands across every part of you. "So, what can I help you with?"

<br><br>
"You sure you want to mess with that lovely face?" She states, caressing your cheek.

<br>"Maybe some breast work? I assure you they are lovely." She says as she brushes the back of your head with her own pair.<br>
<<if $PC.boobsBonus > 0>>

<<if $PC.preg >= 8>>
<br>She darts for your middle.
<<if $PC.preg >= 42>>
	"My word, are you sure you want to have surgery in this state? You're giant!" She says as she uses both hands to massage your overdue belly, enjoying the kicks from your child winthin. "If you go into labor, we have everything you'll need, so don't worry."<br>
<<elseif $PC.preg >= 40>>
	"Wow, are you going to be ok? That looks really heavy." She says as she uses both hands to grope your massive belly, paying extra attention to your navel. "Are you sure you don't want to take a seat?"<br>
<<elseif $PC.preg >= 36>>
	"You're Huge! Look at that adorable navel!" She says as she uses both hands to grope your huge belly, paying extra attention to your navel.<br>

	"Awwww, you're getting soo big!." She says as she rubs your pregnant belly.<br>
<<elseif $PC.preg >= 16>>
	"Awwww, you have a bun in the oven! That's so adorable, didn't think you the type." She says as she pats your rounded middle.<br>
<<elseif $PC.preg >= 12>>
	"Awwww, you have a bun in the oven! That's so adorable, didn't think you the type." She says as she rubs your rounded middle.<br>
<<elseif $PC.preg >= 8>>
	"Awwww, you have a bun in the oven! That's so adorable, didn't think you the type." She says as she rubs your slightly swollen belly. Guess that confirms it.<br>
<</if>>

<br>"How about a new butt?." She says as she wiggles her own at you.<br>

<</if>>

<<if $PC.dick == 1>>
<br>"We could add gel around your testes to make your balls look bigger. Would also dampen any impacts to them as well, if that is anything to consider." She says, running a finger down the length of your shaft.<br>
<<if $PC.ballsImplant > 2>>
	You have an enormous, heavy pair of balls roughly the size of cantaloupes; it's difficult to sit normally, your clothes barely fit, and everyone can tell they are fake, but every slave you fuck gets a distinct slap with each thrust and you love it.
