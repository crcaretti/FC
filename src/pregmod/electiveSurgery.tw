:: Elective Surgery [nobr]

You arrive at your favorite plastic surgeon for your appointment to find them as busy as ever. She wastes no time in hurrying you into her office, stripping you down, measuring you and making sure you are healthy enough for surgery, all the while not so subtly running her hands across every part of you. "So, what can I help you with?"

<br><br>
"You sure you want to mess with that lovely face?" She teases, caressing your cheek. "@@color:yellowgreen;造5000@@. Also wouldn't recommend changing you eyes or skin color; some security systems get real uppity over things like that. Though I s'pose race and hair can fall under that as well, but hey, I'm not good at racial surgery and this isn't a hair salon, so nothing to worry about, right? Yes, I'm certain your systems will recognize you after I finish working on you, give my work some credit."
