Several weeks have passed since you gained the musical prodigy and you couldn't help but notice her constant scowl and muttering about "getting revenge one day" or "wishing her producer would pay for what happened" whenever she was not working. You decide to look into the incident and direct $assistantName to look into the financial situation of her record label. It turns out that not only should this slave not be eligible for enslavement due to her performance profits, but a certain someone has been taking that money for themselves. You issue a bounty for her producer and wait a response. With surprising speed, an answer comes from a bounty hunter. The underhanded producer never left the arcology, instead opting to make use of the guest living arrangements you had set up for the concert. Only when an announcement of the bounty went out did they realize their peril and attempt to flee. The bounty hunter literally drags the escapee by the collar into your penthouse and throws them at your feet. The coward shivers as your eyes meet theirs.

"Please, don't hurt me! I'll pay for that slave I sent you to be released, even set her up with the life she would have had if I hadn't embezzled the profits!"

		You decide to give the victimized prodigy a chance for payback. She moves over to her former boss and begins to caress the despicable coward as they shake with dread of what is to come. As she moves lower, she applies more pressure, peaking right on the genitals. The cowardly former producer yelps in pain, instinctively trying to get away from the hand crushing the most sensitive spot on their body. After several minutes of the coward screaming in pain, the former prodigy gets up and delivers a hard kick to the groin, eliciting another scream and causing her former boss to assume the fetal position. You send for another slave to drag the whimpering former producer to her feet for inspection.

		You decide the coward needs more punishment. You order a whip brought to you and give her several lashes directly across her exposed genetalia. She cries out with each lash as her nethers accumulate angry red welts, some even bleeding slightly. After the yelps stop, you feel enough punishment has been given for now and have the producer turned slave hauled to her feet for a proper inspection.
