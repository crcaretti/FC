	Since you are heavily pregnant with a child of the Societal Elite, you are quickly taken to the finest clinic the arcology has to offer. After a quick sedation, you awake to find your belly no longer round with child; that and a note stating your next breeding partner and a notice that Â¤50000 has been added to your account. The Societal Elite are @@.green;very pleased@@ at their new addition to the ranks. You just wish you could have seen your little <<if $babyGender == 1>>girl<<else>>boy<</if>> before they took <<if $babyGender == 1>>her<<else>>him<</if>> away to be raised into a proper member of the future world.

As time passes, she notices your consciousness begin to fade as exhaustion kicks in. Fearing for your lives, and desperate to save you, she draws her sword from its sheath, hands unsteady from what she is about to do. Carefully, she slits your lower abdomen, allowing your baby-filled womb to pop out through the incision. Doing her best, she cuts open your uterus, pulls your child from you and severs the umbilical cord.
