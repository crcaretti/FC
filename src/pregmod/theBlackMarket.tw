You board your VTOL bird for the trip the the current location of the particularly exclusive, and quite lucrative, Black Market knowing full well that the trip may take far longer than anticipated; the market frequently relocates to shake the unwanted attention it inevitably gains. It's far easier than paying off authorities, especially with how outrageous their demands have become with the decline of the Old World. You're greeting by a gruff bouncer, already fully aware of just who you are and your permission to be there. "Check your weapons - No firearms allowed inside.<<if $Bodyguard != 0>> She may keep her blade," he gestures to $Bodyguard.slaveName, "but keep in mind. If you cause us trouble, you will not be going home in one piece.<<if $Bodyguard.amp <= -4>>" He taps his clearly bionic arm. "Disable her weapons systems. I know what she is capable of.<</if>><</if>>"

Once inside, you are able to fully absorb in the sights and sounds of the market proper. All sorts of items are available for purchase, from exotic beasts that may very well be the last of their kind, to the most lethal of weaponry both old and new, and even luxuries long gone. Despite the overbearing security, one's wallet can easiliy be emptied in this place.
