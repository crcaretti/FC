You simply smile at $him and tell $him not to worry as you continue

$activeSlave.slaveName gives an audible sigh of relief and begins to thank you profusely, though $his thanks are cut short as

<<elseif $killChoice == 1>>
    You make a show of considering sparing $his life, then, with a heavy sigh, unbuckle your pants and sit down at your desk. You beckon to $him, and $he just about trips over $himself as $he hastily makes $his way over to you. $His blowjob isn't the best you've ever had, $him sobbing as much as $he was, though $his enthusiasm more than makes up for it. After you finish deep in $his throat, $he sits back and wipes away $his tears, sniffling and thanking you again for giving $him another chance.

<<elseif $killChoice == 2>>
    You tell $him that you'll let $bodyguard.slaveName decide $his fate. You tell $him that if $he wants to live, $he'll have to beat $him in hand-to-hand combat in the $pitName. 
    <<if $activeSlave.combatSkill == 0>>
        The fear on $his face is palpable, though $he nods slowly and agrees, not seeing another choice. 
    <<else>>
        $He nods $his head and straightens up, as though preparing $himself for the fight for $his life.

    /*TODO: Connect this to the Pit, have a end-of-week event between the Bodyguard and the slave*/
