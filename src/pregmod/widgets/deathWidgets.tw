As $args[0].slaveName is going about $his business with $his overfilled $args[0].inflationType belly, $he can't help but feel exhausted. $His health has been poor lately and the pressure in $his organs is not helping things. $He immediately knows something is wrong when an intense pain runs through $his middle and $his load shifts threateningly. Blood and $args[0].inflationType leak from $his rear as $his body cavity fills with the contents of $his digestive tract. The skin of $his taut belly reddens as the pressure against it builds. As $he takes $his last breath, $he falls forward, $his weight landing upon $his straining stomach. With a gush, $he ruptures, flooding the area around $his with blood, guts and $args[0].inflationType. Word of the late slave and $his gruesome fate spread fast, @@.gold;terrifying@@ your untrusting slaves.
