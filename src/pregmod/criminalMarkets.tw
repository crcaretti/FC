You board the transport to 
<<switch $weeklyMarket>>
<<case "low tier criminals">> /* mixed prisoners */

	a small prison on the edge of the city spanning from the foot of your Arcology with the appearance of an Old World police station. You arrive inside and are met by a cute receptionist, asking why one such as yourself would visit such a place. With formalities out of the way, the head of the station is called and arrives shortly. "Well now, didn’t expect to see you here. Came to pick up a criminal and give them a chance at not being a menial?" You are then led further into the station and into the prisoners quarters; most of them downcast and dismal, but some look up to see what the commotion is about. "You! Come here! This gentleman wants to take a look so be on your best behavior!" the head calls out, bringing one of the criminals close enough to be inspected.

<<case "gangs and smugglers">> /* males only */

	a large gray prison at the edge of the Free City as word of your approach is sent ahead. The visage of the prison itself is a grim one, enclosed by a large gray concrete fence with electrified barbed wire coiled at the top. As the vehicle rolls to a stop before a large gate, the guard in control of the gate operates a board of buttons and levers, promptly opening it so it may continue. "Stay on the road," he respectfully advises, a final remark before letting your driver carries on. Beyond the fence is an array of guard towers manned with drones for 24/7 surveillance, giving you a clear idea of what was to happen if you were not to heed the guard’s words and decided to wander off from the group.
	<br><br>
	Your destination at the end of the road is a garage, where upon your disembarking, no less than 4 heavily armored guards with electric batons at their sides come to greet you. You could almost mistake them for unmanned drones had they not spoken, "We’ve been expecting you, please follow us. We house some dangerous individuals in our establishment and we need to keep you safe". You accept their advice and enter the premises.
	<br><br>
	You are met with a dimly lit concrete hallway as you enter, only for it to open up to a multi-floor prison that had placed its prisoners underground for the most part<<if $PC.title == 0 || $PC.boobsBonus > 1 || $PC.butt > 1>>, where you are met with a hailstorm of whistles, cheers and other catcalls<</if>>. You come to a bridge and look down to see its inhabitants, hard criminals that are coming together for a meal. You watch a fight break out at one point and an armored guard quickly stepped in and applying his baton to the offenders, coupled with a loud zap that silences the entire area. Around your level, you see the better stock; the attractive prisoners one would show to an interested customer.
	<br><br>
	You finally reach the warden’s office, "Welcome <<if $PC.title == 1>>Mister<<else>>Miss<</if>> <<= PlayerName()>>, I never thought my prison could have turned to a trade such as this, but times are hard." He beckons you to the seat opposite him, "but I’m not one to complain when an opportunity such as this comes my way." He motions to his guards to bring in a select stock for your perusal, "We house some tough nuts in this establishment, but if you believe you can capitalize on these criminals, we’ll be happy to have you take them off our hands." The guard returns with a convict ready to be sold.

<<case "white collar">> /* mixed prisoners */

	what looks more like an oversized vacation home rather than something one goes to for committing crimes. You enter the premises into a small chamber with a booth to the side and are immediately met with, "Ah! We’ve been waiting for you. Please go in. We’ll call someone to guide you immediately." 
	<br><br>
	You nod at the prompt and enter further into the luxurious building to find a formally dressed guide and what appears to be the holding area of the prison. The cells, if you can call them that, are large and cozy, each with their own computer and television. The air is also conditioned for their comfort and Old World classical music is playing to provide further ambiance. Walking through, you see the prisoners themselves, lazing about in their beds, sitting at their computers or just talking to each other. If there was ever a prison you’d rather end up in, this would be it.
	<br><br>
	You enter the warden’s office and are greeted with all due formalities, "Glad to see you at our establishment. When I heard that someone as renowned as yourself was coming over, I made the appropriate preparations." You are served a cup of tea as she brings in the chosen stock for you to observe at your leisure.

<<case "military prison">>

	a holding facility for prisoners of war located on the outskirts of the Free City, which is reasonable due to the dangers inherent to the criminals imprisoned in such an establishment. The driver radios ahead that you and several other interested parties will be arriving shortly. Once you disembark at the edge of the grounds, you are recognized by the stationed guard and ushered into a heavily armored vehicle. <<if $PC.career == "mercenary">>The interior brings back memories and you completely<<else>>Although the interior makes you feel like a prisoner, you<</if>> understand the reasoning behind such a design choice.
	<br><br>
	Once you arrive at the prison, the door opens to a garage and another door, brightly lit to welcome you to the premises. Through the door, you find the prisoner’s quarters, each of them enclosed by electrified fences to ensure your safety as you see the stock. A guard enters, asking you to follow him as he leads you across the chamber to meet with the warden.
	<br><br>
	Entering the warden’s quarters, you take a seat across from the warden as he takes the initiative, "Ah, fancy meeting one such as yourself here. Though we house some of the hardiest criminals you can find, I’m sure one such as yourself could find great use for them" He smirks "... or perhaps great entertainment through the pits", he beckons to his staff as they bring in the selected stock.
