			But $he isn't done yet, not that $he'd complain about fulfilling your desires. More and more you feed $him; $his belly swelling ever larger and growing even heavier as $he diligently drinks the slave food. You reposition yourself to get a better hold on $his bulging food baby. As $he passes the gallon mark, you give the swollen orb a good jiggle, eliciting a small sigh followed by a request for more, from the bloated slave and tons of motion under your arm.

			$He still has another gallon to go and $he knows it, but if <<WrittenMaster>> wants $him to be stuffed like a turkey, $he'll happily comply. $He wastes no time in opening up for your next helping. You can feel the pressure growing in $his middle as it fills out under your arm more and more. $He devotedly downs every gulp you give $him and catches $his breath, while being a tease, between helpings. Once the last of the slave food is in $his stomach, you give the firm globe a gentle slap, eliciting a large belch and a playfully stuck out tongue from the stuffed slave. $His belly is as taut as a drum; you rub it some more as you appreciate its size.

After a few minutes of rest, you order $him to continue stuffing $himself to maintain $his current size until you say otherwise. You spend $his remaining time in recovery playing with $his belly. $He joins you in the endeavor, happy that you are pleased with the outcome<<if _doMe == 1>>, but $his <<if canSee($activeSlave)>>eyes tell<<else>>face tells<</if>> you $he wants more<</if>>.
