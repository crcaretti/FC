You walk around $his, drawing closer and slowly resting your hand on $his head. You let it lean for a few seconds for $his to accustom to your touch.

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>

	$He shakes at your touch fearfully. As you tenderly brush your fingers down $his unresisting head again and again, $his eagerness to avoid punishment leads $him to stiffen, making $his nervousness apparent. You continue stroking $him, enjoying $his fear, as the physical intimacy slowly does its work. $He starts to relax, $his resistance easing as $his eyes start to close.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -50)>>
	$He is nearly frozen with fear and does not resist as you tenderly brush your fingers down $his head lovingly again and again. In fact, $he barely reacts at all.
<<else>>
	$He reflexively turns away from you, but you tenderly hold $his chin and maneuver $him in position with one hand and slowly but gently move your other hand to the top of $his head. Spluttering, $he leans backwards, but you catch $him by the shoulder and pin $him against you, where you feel the intense heat from $his body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>, before resuming your gentle stroking. $He tries to wriggle out of your grasp desperately, but $his struggles slowly subside as $he realizes that you're not taking this any farther.

You pat $him softly and use your palm to move down $his head with a soothing touch as pet $his.

You pat $him a few times before letting $him go.

	When you finally stop gently petting $him, $his eyes remain closed and $his mouth in a rapturous shape for a moment before $he slowly opens $his eyes and smiles at you.

	$He tries hard to stop $himself from losing $himself in your masterful hands. $He takes $his tendency towards sexual dominance right up to the edge of insubordination, when $he starts to caress your face in turn. When you finally stop, $his eyes are closed and $he's smiling.

	As you stroke $his head, $he reacts almost as though you're taking $his, beginning to moan and press $himself lewdly against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>prominent breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>. $He achieves a weak orgasm before you stop petting $his; $he is your pet, after all.
