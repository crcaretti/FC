You walk around her, drawing closer and slowly resting your hand on her head. You let it lean for a few seconds for her to accustom to your touch.
<<if ($activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken")>>
	Tenderly you brush your fingers down her head lovingly again and again. She initially reacts slightly to your physical touch but soon stops reacting completely.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -2)>>
	Tenderly you brush your fingers down her head lovingly again and again. She slowly leans her body closer and closer to you, relaxing as she feels your caress.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "dom") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60) && ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>>

<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50)>>
	She accepts your touch with devotion, leaning her head back at your gentle caress. Tenderly you brush your fingers down her head lovingly again and again. She leans her body forward, pressing herself against you. You can feel the intense heat from her body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 20)>>
	She accepts your touch willingly. As you tenderly brush your fingers down her head lovingly again and again, you sense considerable turmoil in the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>girl<</if>>; she's doing her duty as a slave by complying with your wishes, and is probably struggling with the mixture of resistance, obedience and perhaps even devotion forced to the forefront of her mind by your touch.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion >= -20) && ($activeSlave.trust < -20)>>
	She shakes at your touch fearfully. As you tenderly brush your fingers down her unresisting head again and again, her eagerness to avoid punishment leads her to stiffen, making her nervousness apparent. You continue stroking her, enjoying her fear, as the physical intimacy slowly does its work. She starts to relax, her resistance easing as her eyes start to close.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.trust < -50)>>
	She is nearly frozen with fear and does not resist as you tenderly brush your fingers down her head lovingly again and again. In fact, she barely reacts at all.
<<else>>
	She reflexively turns away from you, but you tenderly hold her chin and maneuver her in position with one hand and slowly but gently move your other hand to the top of her head. Spluttering, she leans backwards, but you catch her by the shoulder and pin her against you, where you feel the intense heat from her body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>, before resuming your gentle stroking. She tries to wriggle out of your grasp desperately, but her struggles slowly subside as she realizes that you're not taking this any farther. Tenderly you brush your fingers down her head lovingly again and again.

You pat her softly and use your palm to move down her head with a soothing touch as pet her. Tenderly you start to run your fingers <<if $activeSlave.hStyle == "shaved bald" || $activeSlave.bald == 1>>against her baldness<<else>>through her hair<</if>>, gently running your fingertips down her scalp, softly stroking and caressing her.

You take her head lightly and trace around it, gently massaging as you go.
You pat her a few times before letting her go.

	When you finally stop gently petting her, her eyes remain closed and her mouth in a rapturous shape for a moment before she slowly opens her eyes and smiles at you.

	She tries hard to stop herself from losing herself in your masterful hands. She takes her tendency towards sexual dominance right up to the edge of insubordination, when she starts to caress your face in turn. When you finally stop, her eyes are closed and she's smiling.

	As you stroke her head, she reacts almost as though you're taking her, beginning to moan and press herself lewdly against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>prominent breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>. She achieves a weak orgasm before you stop petting her; she is your pet, after all.
