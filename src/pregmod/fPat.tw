/* action */

You walk around $him, drawing closer and slowly resting your hand on $his head. You let it rest for a few seconds to get $him accustomed to your touch.
<<if ($activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken")>>
	Tenderly and lovingly you brush your fingers along $his head, enjoying the feeling of your poor mentally shattered slave's inability to resist you. $He initially reacts slightly to your physical touch, but soon stops reacting completely.  Nevertheless, you continue to gingerly stroke $his <<if $activeSlave.hStyle == "shaved bald" || $activeSlave.bald == 1>>shaven scalp <<else>>hair <</if>>, as you gently press his body into your chest<<if $activeSlave.amp == 1>> and onto your lap<</if>>. The warmth from your slave's body, and the action of petting $his head, combinded with the sound of $his breathing, allow you to feel more relaxed by the minute.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -3) && $activeSlave.devotion+$activeSlave.trust >= 175>>
	Tenderly and lovingly you brush your fingers along $his head, enjoying the feeling of your slave's utterly willing submission. $He slowly leans $his body closer and closer to you<<if $activeSlave.amp == 1>> and finally onto your lap<</if>>, relaxing as $he feels your caress.  As $he shifts his weight to your chest, $he feels all of the daily stresses of the day melt away, and a deep, happy sigh escapes $his lips.  You smile fondly, allowing all of the troubles of being an arcology owner dissipate, in a similar fashion to your slave. For now, just for now, you are just a <<if $PC.title == 1>>man and his <<else>>woman and her <</if>>devoted and content wife.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.relationship == -2)>>
	Tenderly and lovingly you brush your fingers along $his head, for a moment, appreciating how easily your slave submits to your desire to pat her head. $He slowly leans $his body closer and closer to you<<if $activeSlave.amp == 1>> allowing you to move $him onto your lap<</if>>, relaxing as $he feels your caresses.  As $his weight falls onto you, all of the stress from his body melts away, and a small, respectful sigh escapes $his pursed lips.  You smile fondly, allowing all of the troubles of being an arcology owner drift away, in a similar fashion to your slave.  For now, just for now, you are just a <<if $PC.title == 1>>man and his <<else>>woman and her<</if>>devoted and content servant.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "dom") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60) && ($activeSlave.amp != 1)>>
	As you start to touch $him $he smiles at you and takes your hand, following its movements. You tenderly and lovingly kiss it and let it rest on the side of $his head, before continuing with your ministrations.  As opposed to your more submissive slaves, $activeSlave.slaveName takes an active role in your petting, gently guiding where your hand goes along $his head.  You enjoy the feel of $his hand on yours, as well as $his <<if $activeSlave.hStyle == "shaved bald" || $activeSlave.bald == 1>>smooth scalp<<else>> hair<</if>>.
<<elseif ($activeSlave.devotion > 50) && ($activeSlave.fetish == "submissive") && ($activeSlave.fetishKnown == 1) && ($activeSlave.fetishStrength > 60)>>
	$He stiffens at your touch but slowly relaxes at the sensation of your hand on $his head. You tenderly and lovingly stroke your fingers along $his scalp, enjoying the feeling of your slave's subservience.  $He gently, submissively, presses $his head against your hand, like a dog.  As you continue <<if $activeSlave.hStyle == "shaved bald" || $activeSlave.bald == 1>>kneading $his shaved scalp<<else>>stroking $his hair<</if>>, $he starts to clutch $his thighs, and if you listen you can hear subdued whimpers.  $He looks up at you with adoring eyes, and relishes in the pureness of this act as his master's pet to $his beloved <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title == 1>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>>.
<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion > 50>>
	$He accepts it with devotion, leaning back into your gentle caresses. You tenderly and lovingly brush your fingers along $his head, enjoying the feeling of your slave's willingness to set aside her dignity for headpats. $He leans $his body backward, pressing $himself against you. You can feel the intense heat from $his body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>.  You take your time enjoying the sensation of <<if $activeSlave.hStyle == "shaved bald" || $activeSlave.bald == 1>>rubbing your slave's smooth scalp<<else>>gently running your fingers through your slave's hair<</if>>, and your slave smiles happily as you do.   As you continue with your ministrations, you can see all of the stress present in your slave's shoulders dissipate, and you feel a good deal of your own tention start to melt away as well.
<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion > 20>>
	$He willingly accepts it. As you tenderly and lovingly brush your fingers along $his head, enjoying the feeling of your slave's roiling emotions, and finally submission. You can still sense considerable turmoil in the <<if ($activeSlave.physicalAge > 30)>>woman<<else>>$girl<</if>>; $he's doing $his duty as a slave by complying with your wishes, and is probably struggling with the mixture of resistance, obedience and perhaps even devotion forced to the forefront of $his mind by your touch.  As you continue your ministrations, your slave slowly, and with more then a bit of uncertainty, finally starts to relax.  $He looks at you with confusion and trepidation.  Your eyes betray nothing however, you simply smile and press $his head into your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>masculine chest<</if>>, all the while enjoying the feeling of your <<if $activeSlave.hStyle == "shaven bald" || $activeSlave.bald == 1>>hands gliding over $his smooth head<<else>>fingers gliding through $his hair<</if>>.
<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion >= -20 && $activeSlave.trust < -20>>
	$He shakes at your touch fearfully. As you tenderly brush your fingers down $his unresisting head, you appreciate this expression of your slave's subservience, $his eagerness to avoid punishment making $him stiffen, $his nervousness easily apparent. You continue stroking $him, enjoying $his fear, as the physical intimacy slowly does its work. $He starts to relax, $his resistance easing as $his eyes start to close.  Your hands continue to gently scratch at $his scalp, and you enjoy the sensation as well as the feeling of power over your hapless slave.  Gently, slowly, so not as to spook $him, you ease your property's head back into your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>breasts<<else>>chest<</if>>.  Nevertheless your slave starts at the action, but at your insistence finally gives in to the motion, and finally relaxes against you.
<<elseif $activeSlave.trust < -50>>
	$He is nearly frozen with fear and does not resist as you tenderly and lovingly brush your fingers along $his head, enjoying your slave's complete and utter submission to you. In fact, $he barely reacts at all.  But being an arcology owner has taught you many things, not least of which is patience.  With time and a gentle hand, your slave's shoulders slowly start to relax, so slowly if you weren't paying attention you wouldn't have noticed.  With a sense of satisfaction, you continue your actions, enjoying the feeling of your <<if $activeSlave.hStyle == "shaven bald" || $activeSlave.bald == 1>>hand gliding over $his smooth head<<else>>fingers combing through $his hair and gently scritching $his scalp<</if>>.  You settle with this for now, knowing that any attempt at further intimacy will likely scare your slave off, but you enjoy it nonetheless.
<<else>>
	$He reflexively turns away from you, but you tenderly hold $his chin and maneuver $him in position with one hand and slowly but gently move your other hand to the top of $his head. Spluttering, $he leans backwards, but you catch $him by the shoulder and pin $him against you, where you feel the intense heat from $his body against your <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>soft breasts<<else>>manly chest<</if>>, before resuming your gentle stroking. $He desperately tries to wriggle out of your grasp, but $his struggles slowly subside as $he realizes that you're not taking this any farther. Tenderly and lovingly you stroke your fingers over $his head, appreciating the feeling of your slave's rebelliousness.
<</if>>

You pat $him softly move your palm down the side of $his head with a soothing touch as you pet $him. Gently you start to run your down the back of his head, softly stroking and caressing $him. You delicately lift $his head and touch your fingertips to $his chin, tenderly brushing along the line of $his mouth with the your <<if $PC.title == 1>>manly<<else>>feminine<</if>> thumb.

<<if $activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken">>
  This causes an unconcious shiver to travel down $his spine.
<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion >= 50>>
	This causes $him to shudder in delight and to move $his hand to your hip, squeezing it gently.

	This causes $him to shudder in delight.
<<elseif $activeSlave.devotion >= -20>>
	This causes $him to shiver unconciously.
<<elseif $activeSlave.trust <= -50>>
	This forces $his back rigid, in an effort not to move an inch, out of fear.
<<elseif $activeSlave <= -21>>
	This would cause $him to shiver with delight, but her distaste for the situation makes that impossible.
<</if>>

You move your hand down to caress $his forehead, and then slide your hand along $his cheek.  The last thing you do is take $his head lightly and trace around it, gently massaging as you go.  Finally you pat $him a few times before letting $him up.

	$He tries hard to stop from losing $himself in your incredibly skilled hands. $He takes $his tendency towards sexual dominance right up to the edge of insubordination, when $he starts to caress your face in turn. When you finally stop, $his eyes are closed and $he's smiling. When you are finally finished stroking your slave, they remove their hand from yours. Then you give them a playful flick on the nose, and the mischievous twinkle in your eye is only half playful, reminding $him of $his place in these walls.
