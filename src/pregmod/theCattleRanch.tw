//The Cattle Ranch is a controversial slave school operating primarily out of Pastoralistic Free Cities. Its business model is to offer the ideal free range dairy cow; one whose tits and belly reach the floor when she is on all fours. All cattle come optimized for milking, with big breasts and gravid middles. Slave orphans have their heels clipped shortly after birth and are conditioned to believe they are actual livestock, resulting in a mindbreak like state. Between their wide hips and big butts and their heavy, milky breasts, they are often popular breeding slaves. They rarely display their stock over video call, instead favoring a more hands-on approach. Buyers can visit their local shops to view grazing cattle available for sale. Alternatively, they can watch the calves frolic among their mothers or enjoy the sight of a breeding bull impregnating an empty womb. Cows are also specially trained to respond to spectators banging on the fence; oral awaits if you drop trou for them! <<if $TCR.schoolUpgrade != 0>><br><br>You have endowed <<if $TCR.schoolUpgrade == 1>>a healthy sum of credits to make their breeding bulls available for sale.<<else>>a healthy sum of credits to encourage the sale of heifers.<</if>> As a major <<if $PC.title == 0>>benefactrix<<else>>benefactor<</if>> of the ranch, you also receive a discount on them.<</if>>//
