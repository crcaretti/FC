$incubaterNameCaps is a clean, cold hall designed to be lined with vats and their connected monitoring systems.

<<if $incubatorSlaves > 2>>
	It's well used. The hum of active vats fill the air.
<<elseif $incubatorSlaves > 0>>
	It's barely used; most of the vats lie dormant.

	It's empty and quiet. [[Decommission the incubator|Main][$incubator to 0, $incubatorUpgradeSpeed = 0, $incubatorUpgradeWeight = 0, $incubatorUpgradeMuscles = 0, $incubatorUpgradeReproduction = 0, $vats = 0]]
