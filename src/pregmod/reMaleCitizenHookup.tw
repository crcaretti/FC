At night, the best living areas in the arcology offer a constant melange of selective entertainments. There's a perpetual social scrum of who is to be invited to what going on, and you occupy a preeminent place atop it, mostly aloof from the struggles of your citizens for recognition and influence. You're invited to almost everything, since everyone who lives here knows the value of being in favor with the owner of the arcology. Invitations to your parties, of course, are some of the most valuable social currency in the arcology and one of $assistantName's most important duties is to help you manage them without wasting your valuable time. It's not actually necessary for you to attend your own parties, since almost everyone will be glad to be seen in the entertainment area of the penthouse whether or not the propriet<<if $PC.title == 1>>or<<else>>ress<</if>> is actually present.

They're performing a complex dance of social dominance, and it all radiates around you, with complex unspoken rules of collective approval governing which citizens cycle past you for a word, and for how long.

	You thank her for her praise, weighting the words in just the right way to communicate that you consider her flirtations worthy compliments, and nothing more. She understands immediately, communicating acceptance and pleasure at her own daring with nothing more than a thankful look in your eyes. This is how you approach matters like this. You are the ruler of this place and it behooves you to maintain a balance atop all your citizens without showing any susceptibility to solicitation. A little incident like this has little effect on its own, but your habit of maintaining proper reserve creates a reputation for judiciousness that @@color:green;businesspeople consider attractive for arcology investment.@@

	You're not exactly starved for casual sex, but you've never thought there was any such thing as too much of a good thing. You place a <<if $PC.title == 1>>masculine<<else>>feminine<</if>> hand against the small of her back, feeling the warmth of her through the material of her evening wear. You hear a slight gasp from her as she realizes that her gambit has succeeded with more immediate effect than she expected.

	Citizens like her often appreciate a good hard fuck, since regular submission to a pounding from sex slaves would be a scandal. There's little opprobium waiting for you if it's known you had her, though, and she's deliciously eager as you press her down onto the bed<<if $PC.dick == 0>> and pull on your usual harness<</if>>. She ruts herself hard back against you as you thrust into her, moaning, and after a short while she begs for it even harder, so you flip her over and mount her like a bitch, making her scream.

	You turn to face her straight on, and something about the look in your eye fills her with mixed apprehension and anticipation.

You're speaking in a tone that cuts through the room, and by the time you kiss your willing conquest, there's not a person in the room who isn't paying attention. They all understand the message: this gathering is turning into something else, now. Those few who aren't willing to fuck in public withdraw, and everyone who didn't come with a sexual partner sends urgent messages to have appropriate slaves brought from their apartments.
