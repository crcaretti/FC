:: PC Preg Intro [nobr] 
 
You have a working female reproductive system, and thus, a menstrual cycle. Women already face hardships as slaveowners and arcology owners, and being pregnant, coupled with a strong societal aversion to the dominant being penetrated, leads most pregnant owners to find themselves in dire situations. As an added precaution, since nothing stops an owner from hooking up with another owner, contraceptives are common amongst free women.
