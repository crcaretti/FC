:: Breeder Proposal [nobr]

<<set $nextButton = " ", $nextLink = "Main", $propOutcome = -1>>

You draft a proposal to the Societal Elite proposing the use of specially tested slaves as breeding stock. If they can pass the tests required to join the societal elite; even as slaves, their bodies can prove valuable to furthering eugenics. They will gain no additional rights, but their wombs will be used to birth elite children; helping stave off potential threats of inbreeding and adding possible missed beneficial traits into the Elite's gene pool.

Within the hour, you are called before <<if $eugenicsFullControl == 1>>what's left of <</if>>The Societal Elite.
