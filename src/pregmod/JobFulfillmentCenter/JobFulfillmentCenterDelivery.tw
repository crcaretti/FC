A slave dealer has submitted a slave to satisfy your ''$Role'' order.

<br><br>//As usual, the asking price is quite high, to cover the costs of finding a slave to order. In compensation, you can freely decline the slave and keep the order open, or even modify it later.//

			She has been reasonably broken by the dealer that offered her to you. She has also picked up on the fact that she was specially selected, and is a little hopeful that this means she may be treated well. She is now awaiting your instructions.
