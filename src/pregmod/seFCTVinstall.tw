You've been sitting in your office into the early afternoon going over bothersome lease documents that need your approval. When you take a break to look out the window, $assistantName speaks up. "<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, you have received an approval welcome packet from 8HGG Inc in regards to Free Cities TV. It seems that they've determined that $arcologyName is now sufficiently developed enough to warrant a FCTV-Citizen connection. All the details and contracts necessary are included in the packet." You nod in acknowledgement.
