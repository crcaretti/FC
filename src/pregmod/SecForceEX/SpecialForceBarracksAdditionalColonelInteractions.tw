				You ask The Colonel if she would like to stretch her legs up on the surface. It doesn't take much effort for her to agree.
				<<if $PC.warfare < 10>>
					<br>Your complete lack of skill at warfare ensures that <<if $Bodyguard != 0>>in addition to $Bodyguard.slaveName, <</if>>you need; two full squads of $securityForceName on foot, a squadron of fighters, a small convoy of $securityForceName's ground vehicles.
				<<elseif $PC.warfare >= 100 && $PC.career == "mercenary">>
					<br>Your mastery of wet work and prior experience in a PMC satisfies The Colonel that you only need one soldier and a single vehicle<<if $Bodyguard != 0>> plus $Bodyguard.slaveName<</if>>. Being able to see and interact with the arcology owner even more directly if they so wish boosts the mood of your citizen's while also giving them an increased opportunity to try gaining favour with you.

					<br>Your expertise in warfare means that <<if $Bodyguard != 0>>in addition to $Bodyguard.slaveName <</if>>you need; two full squads of $securityForceName on foot, a squadron of fighters and a large convoy of $securityForceName's ground vehicles.

				<<if $arcologies[0].FSPaternalist != "unset">>
					Stopping at a paternalist shop, you help The Colonel select some luxurious and relaxing treatments for her main slave.
					<<if $PC.slaving < 10>>
						Your total lack of slavery skill (which is very unusual and very concerning for an arcology owner) means that you are of little to no help or even a hindrance.
					<<elseif $PC.slaving >= 100>>
						Your mastery of slaving allows you assist The Colonel greatly. However the shop owner is so impressed by your understanding of slavery that she is more than happy for an endorsement from you. As you are exiting the shop you hear your pre-recorded message which bears the slogan "This is (<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle <</if>> <<PlayerName>>) and this is my favorite Paternalist shop in $arcologies[0].name."

						Your basic skill at slavery, allows you to neither be a hindrance or helpful.

					Stopping at a shop.

				<br>Soon the entourage heads back to the HQ of $securityForceName. Along the route you see a homeless citizen in great pain.
				<<if $PC.medicine < 10>>
					Your total lack of medical skill causes the death of the citizen.
					<<set $arcologies[0].prosperity -= .25>>
				<<elseif $PC.medicine >= 100 && $PC.career == "medicine">>
					Your expertise in medicine ensures that the citizen is probably the best they have ever been. They are so grateful that they are more than happy to try and compensate your time. Word quickly spreads of the kindly medically trained arcology owner who took the time to heal a citizen, providing confidence to the rest of the citizens.

				<<elseif $PC.medicine >= 30>>
					Your moderate skill in medicine ensures that the citizen's condition ever so slightly improves.
				<<elseif $PC.medicine >= 10>>
					Your basic skill in medicine is sufficient only to stabilize the citizen.
