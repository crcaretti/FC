			You ask The Colonel if she would like to stretch her legs up on the surface. It doesn't take much effort for her to agree.

				<br>Your mastery of wet work and prior experience in a PMC satisfies The Colonel that you only need one soldier and a single vehicle<<if $Bodyguard != 0>> plus $Bodyguard.slaveName<</if>>. Being able to see and interact with the arcology owner even more directly if they so wish boosts the mood of your citizen's while also giving them an increased opportunity to try gaining favor with you.

			<<if $arcologies[0].FSPaternalist != "unset">>
				Stopping at a paternalist shop, you help The Colonel select some luxurious and relaxing treatments for her main slave.
				<<if $PC.slaving < 10>>
					Your total lack of slavery skill (which is very unusual and very concerning for an arcology owner) means that you are of little to no help or even a hindrance.
				<<elseif $PC.slaving >= 100>>
					Your mastery of slaving allows you assist The Colonel greatly. Also the shop owner is so impressed by your understanding of slavery that she is more than happy for an endorsement from you. As you are exiting the shop you hear your pre-recorded message which bears the slogan "This is <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle <</if>> <<= PlayerName()>> and this is my favorite Paternalist shop in $arcologies[0].name."

					Possessing some skill, you are slightly helpful.

					Your basic skill at slavery, allows you to neither be a hindrance or helpful.

			<<else>> Stopping at a shop. <</if>>
			<br>Soon the entourage heads back to the HQ of $securityForceName. Along the route you see a homeless citizen in great pain.

				Your total lack of medical skill causes the death of the citizen.
				<<set $arcologies[0].prosperity -= .25>>
			<<elseif $PC.medicine >= 100 && $PC.career == "medicine">>
				Your expertise in medicine ensures that the citizen is probably the best they have ever been. They are so grateful that they are more than happy to try and compensate your time. Word quickly spreads of the kindly medically trained arcology owner who took the time to heal a citizen, providing confidence to the rest of the citizens.
