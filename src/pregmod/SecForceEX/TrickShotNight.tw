:: Trick Shot Night  [nobr]

<<set $nextButton = "Continue", $nextLink = "RIE Eligibility Check", $returnTo = "RIE Eligibility Check">>

Despite your direct elevator, interaction with the majority of your security force is relatively scarce. Aside from mutually exchanged nods in the firebase and the occasional briefing, your $securityForceName enjoy a degree of autonomy.

<br><br>On a particularly lackadaisical evening, you find yourself alerted to a message alert by $assistantName.
<<if $assistant > 0>>
	"<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>>, a message from $securityForceName." She pauses before continuing. "It seems they're asking if you'd like to join their trick shot night."
<<else>>
	It informs you that $securityForceName have sent a message asking you to join them at their trick shot night.
<</if>>

<br><br> <span id="result"> <<link "Politely decline">>
	<<replace "#result">>
		You inform $securityForceName that you aren't planning to attend. A short while later, you receive a message from them stating that their invitation is an open one and that you're welcome to join in another night.

<<if $cash < 500000>>
	<br>//You lack the necessary funds to attend.//

	<<replace "#result">> <<set $PC.warfare += 1>>
		You instruct to $assistantName to inform $securityForceName that you will be attending their trick shot night, and after settling your affairs in the penthouse you head down to the firebase. The atmosphere in the firebase is casual, especially in comparison to the usual situations you meet them, though your security force still maintain some measure of decorum towards you as their employer. Eventually, you settle in at the table with a handful of $securityForceName officers and cash in your @@.yellowgreen;<<print cashFormat(500000)>>@@ into bullets. All that remains is to decide your strategy for the night.

			<<if random(1,100) > 50>>
			Despite your attempts to mitigate risk and play the safest shots possible, it seems lady luck has conspired against you this evening. However, even when your last bullet is shot, your security force pitch you a few bullets to keep you in the game for the rest of the night. You may have lost most of your 造, but it seems you've @@.green;made some friends.@@
			<<set $rep += 1000, $cash -= 250000>>
			<<else>>
			While a careful eye for accuracy has buoyed you through the evening, ultimately lady luck is the decider in handing you the win in a number of close shots. Unfortunately your meticulous play limited your chance at a larger payout, and you only come away from the evening with @@.yellowgreen;<<print cashFormat(100000)>>@@ more than you arrived with and @@.green;the respect of your security force.@@

	<br> <<link "Up the ante">>
		<<replace "#bountyresult">>
			Some aggressive play and an eye for riling up your fellow players has resulted in an immense payout, and all but one of your adversaries have folded as the situation has escalated. The only player still in contention is a wily old mercenary, the veteran of her fair share of battles on the battlefield and at the firing range. She's short on bullets, however, and she'll have to buy in with something else as collateral.

						For all your skillful maneuvering to reach this position, ultimately the win comes down to chance. This time, however, luck was not on your side.

						For all your skillful maneuvering to reach this position, ultimately the win comes down to chance. This time, however, luck has rendered you the victor. A silence falls over the room as the result is declared, but after some time your opponent breaks the hush by joking that life as your slave is probably easier than fighting for $arcologies[0].name. After some awkward laughter the night continues, and at the end your former mercenary joins you on your trip back to the penthouse to submit to processing and to begin her new life as your sexual servant. She's not young, but she's tough and not distrusting of you due to her service in $securityForceName.
