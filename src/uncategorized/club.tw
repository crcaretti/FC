$clubNameCaps
<<switch $clubDecoration>>
<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
	is decorated like a Roman villa's entertainment rooms. There is a lot of white stone, plaster, and terracotta.
<<case "Aztec Revivalist">>
	is decorated with obsidian figures inserted in the lime walls and giant oak pillars that give a homey feeling to the otherwise cold building.
<<case "Egyptian Revivalist">>
	is decorated like a room in an ancient Egyptian palace. There are columns of warm stone and pools of clear water full of aquatic plants.
<<case "Edo Revivalist">>
	is furnished as an Edo period theatre. Performances of the traditional Japanese arts can be seen here, though more modern dancing happens in the evenings. In either case, geisha girls are present and willing.
<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>
	is designed like an open plaza in an Arabian palace, with a raised stage in the center for erotic dancing. Diaphanous, flowing curtains billow across the space, dispersing the narcotic smoke billowing from a score of hookahs.
<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
	is furnished as an old Chinese disorderly house. It's intentionally packed in so that closeness and good cheer is obligatory here; prominent citizens share tables while their hangers-on jostle for room.
<<case "Chattel Religionist">>
	isn't a religious establishment, but it almost looks like one. It's clean and proper, with beams of natural light that come down to highlight holy sex slaves' bodies.
<<case "Degradationist">>
	has a perverted, debauched appearance. The decor is utilitarian so it can be cleaned easily, and the reason is obvious. Many patrons have brought their own slaves to publicly rape here.
<<case "Repopulation Focus">>
	has a gaudy appearance. There are lots of deep soft chairs for pregnant patrons and slaves to rest in and screens showing girls with large bellies lining the walls.
<<case "Eugenics">>
	has a gaudy appearance. There are screens lining the walls discouraging unprotected slave sex. The real action happens in the several exclusive rooms reserved for society's best.
<<case "Asset Expansionist">>
	has a gaudy appearance. There are a lot of neon lights and there are screens everywhere, showing off big tits and plush asses.
<<case "Transformation Fetishist">>
	has a gaudy appearance. There are a lot of neon lights and there are screens everywhere, showing off huge fake tits and plastic dick sucking lips.
<<case "Gender Radicalist">>
	has a gaudy appearance. There are a lot of neon lights and there are screens everywhere, showing closeups of cocks fucking every imaginable orifice.
<<case "Gender Fundamentalist">>
	has an old world appearance, a decidedly throwback atmosphere harking back to the glory days of cultures past.
<<case "Physical Idealist">>
	isn't a gym, but it smells like one. The dancing is rough and competitive, and the drinks are rich with protein.
<<case "Supremacist">>
	is decorated like an upper-class gentleman's club in the old countries of $arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace people.
<<case "Subjugationist">>
	is decorated like an upper-class gentleman's club in the old countries which favored $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace slaves.
<<case "Paternalist">>
	is handsome and well-kept, even romantic. Though the slaves here are sex slaves, every provision is made to encourage them to enjoy themselves.
<<case "Pastoralist">>
	is decorated to resemble a frontier disorderly house. The drinks are pounded straight, and there's a set of swinging doors for bad men to part dramatically as they enter.
<<case "Maturity Preferentialist">>
	is surprisingly elegant. The music consists of refined remixes of traditional dance music, offering slaves and citizens the chance to dance beautifully together.
<<case "Youth Preferentialist">>
	is deafeningly loud. There's a bright light show running, offering staccato glimpses of the scene out on the dance floor.
<<case "Body Purist">>
	is gorgeous, decorated and kept in the height of fashionable night establishment style. The music is cutting edge and everything and everyone is elegant.
<<case "Slimness Enthusiast">>
	is distinctly gaudy, with lots of sugary drinks on offer. The music and decor are of a decidedly bubblegum quality.
<<default>>
	is set up in an uncomplicated way. There's a bar for drinks, a dance floor for slave girls, and private rooms for slave sex.
