all .tw passages that are included from other passages via the <<include>> macro should be stored in this folder or its subfolders for organizational purposes

for these included passages, it is not safe to assume that a temporary variable (starting with underscore _ character) will be confined in scope to that file alone

when passages are included by other passages, any variables that they set will override variables in the calling passage, so extra care should be taken in these passages if they use $i, _i, _j or other common variable names to ensure that callers are not expecting those variables to be unchanged after the include
