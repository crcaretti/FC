	_winner.slaveName and _loser.slaveName are both blind making the fight a staredown. Neither slave wants to make the first move, especially with the drowning cacophony coming from the jeering crowd. Slowly, _winner.slaveName moves forward, waving feeling for her opponent before she herself gets found. _loser.slaveName's hand meets _winner.slaveName's and the two move to grab eachother in a headlock. The two slaves violently thrash against each other, suffering more and more strikes as the struggle goes on. Eventually, _loser.slaveName can take no more and releases her grip on _winner.slaveName neck. It takes a moment for _winner.slaveName to stop wrestling the submitting _loser.slaveName and accepting her victory.

That is the end.

With heavy steps, _loser.slaveName rushes her, fully prepared to tackle the helpless combatant. _winner.slaveName gambles everything on a single high punch, a strike that slams _loser.slaveName's undefended neck. _loser.slaveName falls to the ground before the panicking _winner.slaveName, who quickly pins the coughing loser.

		_winner.slaveName wants to win and is confident she will, but she isn't particularly sure about how to do so. She fights cautiously, mostly hitting _loser.slaveName from afar. Slowly, the rain of blows begins to tell, opening _loser.slaveName's lip, giving her a bloody nose, and bruising her face. Realizing she has to do something, _loser.slaveName makes a desperate counterattack, @@color:red;dripping blood@@ as she goes. As she does she manages to get her face in the way of another of _winner.slaveName's inexpert strikes and goes down hard. She makes to rise, but _winner.slaveName decides the fight by the simple expedient of kicking her in the crotch.

In an effort to defend herself, _winner.slaveName hoists her belly and turns suddenly, accidentally impacting _loser.slaveName with her massive pregnancy and knocking her to the ground.  Seeing an oppertunity, _winner.slaveName releases her grip and slams her weighty womb down on _loser.slaveName bashing the wind out of her.  _loser.slaveName struggles to slip out of her squirming prison but the wight is too great and she passes out.

After three tries she manages to bring _loser.slaveName to the ground, suffering a @@color:red;broken nose@@ as she does. _loser.slaveName tries to break the imperfect hold but only earns herself an elbow to the face.

When her back hits a padded wall, _winner.slaveName manages to land a light hit to her stomach that leaves _loser.slaveName winded enough that a hard kick to the side of her knee goes undefended.

Her piercing catches on _winner.slaveName's glove and tears out. _loser.slaveName goes after her tormentor in fury, streaming blood, the piercing forgotten on the mat. Any tendency _winner.slaveName might have had to feel badly about this is extinguished by the assault, and soon _winner.slaveName is even willing to follow up on the success by targeting pierced body parts.

She pulls her down, and then it's all over but the beating. _loser.slaveName rains blows on her huge oppressor, but all _winner.slaveName has to do is hold on with one arm and deliver damage with the other.

This is a sucker punch of the worst kind; _loser.slaveName's boobs are so big that she has no real chance of defending them. She gasps with pain and wraps her arms around her aching bosom, giving _winner.slaveName a clear opening to deliver a free and easy blow to the jaw that sends the poor top-heavy slave to the mat. Any chance of _loser.slaveName rising is extinguished by her breasts; it takes her so long to muster an attempt to get up that _winner.slaveName can rain hits on her while she does.
