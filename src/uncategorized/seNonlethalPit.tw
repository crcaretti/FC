The two slaves violently thrash against each other, suffering more and more strikes as the struggle goes on. Eventually, _loser.slaveName can take no more and releases her grip on _winner.slaveName neck.

	Upon your word the two combatants approach each other warily, both knowing the other is reasonably competent. Before long they are trading expert blows. _winner.slaveName is getting the worst of it, so she decides to change the nature of the fight. After three tries she manages to bring _loser.slaveName to the ground, suffering a @@.red;broken nose@@ as she does. _loser.slaveName tries to break the imperfect hold but only earns herself an elbow to the face.

	_winner.slaveName realizes that _loser.slaveName's wingspan gives her a huge reach advantage. She bores straight in, taking a hit or two but coming on regardless. _loser.slaveName understands her opponent's intention and backs off, but the pit is small and there isn't much room to retreat. When her back hits a padded wall, _winner.slaveName manages to land a light hit to her stomach that leaves _loser.slaveName winded enough that a hard kick to the side of her knee goes undefended.

	The fight starts slowly, with the girls trading jabs. Just as the spectators are getting bored, _loser.slaveName takes a glancing blow to the eyebrow. Her piercing catches on _winner.slaveName's glove and tears out. _loser.slaveName goes after her tormentor in fury, streaming blood, the piercing forgotten on the mat. Any tendency _winner.slaveName might have had to feel badly about this is extinguished by the assault, and soon _winner.slaveName is even willing to follow up on the success by targeting pierced body parts.

The pit isn't large, however, and eventually _winner.slaveName manages to lay a hand on her. She pulls her down, and then it's all over but the beating. _loser.slaveName rains blows on her huge oppressor, but all _winner.slaveName has to do is hold on with one arm and deliver damage with the other.

This is a sucker punch of the worst kind; _loser.slaveName's boobs are so big that she has no real chance of defending them. She gasps with pain and wraps her arms around her aching bosom, giving _winner.slaveName a clear opening to deliver a free and easy blow to the jaw that sends the poor top-heavy slave to the mat. Any chance of _loser.slaveName rising is extinguished by her breasts; it takes her so long to muster an attempt to get up that _winner.slaveName can rain hits on her while she does.
