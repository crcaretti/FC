Slowly, _winner.slaveName moves forward, waving feeling for her opponent before she herself gets found. _loser.slaveName's hand meets _winner.slaveName's and the two move to grab eachother in a headlock. The two slaves violently thrash against each other, suffering more and more strikes as the struggle goes on. Eventually, _loser.slaveName can take no more and releases her grip on _winner.slaveName neck. It takes a moment for _winner.slaveName to stop wrestling the submitting _loser.slaveName and accepting her victory.

Realizing she has to do something, _loser.slaveName makes a desperate counterattack, @@.red;dripping blood@@ as she goes.

	The fight starts slowly, with the girls trading jabs. Just as the spectators are getting bored, _loser.slaveName takes a glancing blow to the eyebrow. Her piercing catches on _winner.slaveName's glove and tears out. _loser.slaveName goes after her tormentor in fury, streaming blood, the piercing forgotten on the mat. Any tendency _winner.slaveName might have had to feel badly about this is extinguished by the assault, and soon _winner.slaveName is even willing to follow up on the success by targeting pierced body parts.
