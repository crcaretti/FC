Prosperity builds at the same rate (adds an extra 5% prosperity per week along the same guidelines as rep using the same logic), and is then applied to the prosperity if the result would be less than/equal to the current prosperity cap. Positive reputation applies a significant positive multiplier (lets go trade with the nice people!), negative reputation applies a significant negative multiplier (trade routes are safe, yeah, but you know, they, uh, murder people for their jewelry and then enslave their children). */
