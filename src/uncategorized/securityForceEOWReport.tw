/* Trade Protection Calculations. Protecting trade is a reputation/prosperity builder and provides a few event triggers. Base rep build of 2.5%/week. Each upgrade adds 0.25%, drones and barracks are twice as powerful (swarms to patrol smaller routes while the troops secure the major ones and improved cordination, etc.), to reach a theoretical max of 5% rep boost per week from that (before subsequent modifiers and calculations at EOW). Personnel gates apply a further 0.5% modifier per gate. Prosperity builds at the same rate (adds an extra 5% prosperity per week along the same guidelines as rep using the same logic), and is then applied to the prosperity if the result would be less than/equal to the current prosperity cap. Positive reputation applies a significant positive multiplier (lets go trade with the nice people!), negative reputation applies a significant negative multiplier (trade routes are safe, yeah, but you know, they, uh, murder people for their jewelry and then enslave their children). */
