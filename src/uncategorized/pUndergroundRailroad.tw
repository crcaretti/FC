One fine day, as normal as any day surrounded by your slaves can be, you're sitting at your desk when a message comes in. <<if $assistantName == "your personal assistant">>Your personal assistant<<else>>$assistantName<</if>> totally fails to announce it, which is unusual; when you ask her why not, she replies
<<if $assistant > 0>>
	flirtatiously, "What message, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>?"
	<<switch $assistantAppearance>>
	<<case "monstergirl">>

		Her avatar gives a little shriek of frustration.
	<<case "businesswoman">>

	<<case "imp">>
		A concerned look forms on her face as she hovers nearby.
	<<case "witch">>
		A look of worry spreads across her face; a lingering dread that she did something bad.

		Her avatar twitches slightly before sprouting multiple eyes facing all directions.

This is disturbing, to say the least. After close investigation, it appears someone has managed to plant a simple text message in your mail system without $assistantName or any of your other security systems taking any notice. Worse, your mysterious correspondent seems willing to show off this ability in this petty display rather than simply sending a message anonymously.

<br><br>

"You will immediately free $activeSlave.slaveName," it reads. "This is the price of your continued survival. Agree and you buy yourself a few more moments at the top of your heap of shit. Refuse, and you shall fall that much sooner." The message is signed "The Daughters of Liberty."

<br><br>
<<Enunciate $activeSlave>>

You call $activeSlave.slaveName in and politely inquire as to whether she knows anything about the matter. She nearly flees in terror, but gathers her courage and
<<if !canTalk($activeSlave)>>
	gestures meekly
<<elseif ($activeSlave.lips > 70)>>
	lisps meekly through her huge lips
<<elseif ($activeSlave.lipsPiercing+$activeSlave.tonguePiercing > 2)>>
	lisps meekly through her piercings
<<else>>
	mumbles meekly
<</if>>
that several nondescript citizens she sees occasionally at work have passed a few messages to her. Apparently, they simply asked whether she wished to be free. Asked whether she does in fact wish to be free, she
<<if !canTalk($activeSlave)>>
	shakily gestures an apology, and admits that she does.
<<else>>
	<<if SlaveStatsChecker.checkForLisp($activeSlave)>>
		lisps faintly,
	<<else>>
		mutters faintly,
	<</if>>
	"I'm <<s>>orry, <<Master>>. Ye<<s>>."

	You calmly inform her that she's free to go. She almost collapses with shock, but turns and hurries out of the arcology, tears streaming from her eyes. She wanders down through the arcology, attracting little notice. One moment the monitors have her struggling through a dense-packed crowd, and the next, they don't.
