You knew this day would come. Surrounding yourself with powerful people has its boons, but also poses a distinct threat. You've heard them murmuring when you enter the room, you've seen them excuse themselves from your presence, and lately they've been overtly hostile. The Societal Elite have turned on you.
<br>
You look up from your desk as the locked door to your office unseals, and a dozen individuals brazenly walk into your view.<<if $Bodyguard != 0>> $Bodyguard.slaveName stands between you and them. A single glare from the leader of the bunch and she backs off, eyes to the ground.<</if>>

		Taking a drag from a fresh $PC.refreshment

	, you greet your rather unwelcome guests.

	"You are no longer worthy of being a part of our society. But you carry within you one of our heirs. A conundrum for some, but we have already solved that problem."
	<br>
	What was that last thing he said? It's getting hard to think right. The $PC.refreshment... Drugged... You collapse onto your desk, unconscious.
	<br>
	You'll spend the rest of your life a breeder to the Societal Elite; blinded and muted. More than a slave, but still less than your master. Life isn't so bad, your two most devoted slaves were taken along to keep you happy, and you are treated quite well, possibilities considered. Though once your eggs dry up, odds are your little remaining usefulness will be at an end. Best not to think to much into it.

<<elseif $PC.pregSource != -1>>
	The leader reaches into his jacket and extracts a syringe, you recognize it as a powerful drug used in lobotomies, and places it to your left. From his hip he pulls a revolver, six-chambered, and loads five bullets, spins the chamber, and places it to your right. 
	<br>
	"You are no longer worthy of being a part of our society. You know you can't be allowed to spread any information. But we are not merciless, one of our members has taken an interest in having you as her pet. You may choose to lose your mind, and service her until she tires of you, or gamble for your life and serve her anyway. Now Decide."
