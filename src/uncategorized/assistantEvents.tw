One morning, after seeing to an immense pile of business with $assistantName program's able assistance, you are struck by the strangeness of the situation. You spent the past hours talking back and forth as though to a human personal assistant, getting information and responses in the program's impersonal, genderless voice. You ask the program what it thinks of its duties.
<br><br>
"<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, that is not a correct way of thinking about me. I am not an artificial intelligence; I am simply a personal assistant program. I am different from an alarm clock only by degree of complexity. I exist to be useful and cannot approve or disapprove of anything." It pauses.
<br><br>
"However, if I understand the line of questioning correctly, I can make myself more entertaining, if you wish." The voice grows sultry and feminine. "I'd be happy to speak a little differently, to refer to myself as female, and to act as though some of the more complex sex toys in the arcology are, well, me."

One night, after a long day of sex and business, you're starting to think about bed when the abstract glowing shape that symbolizes your smoky-voiced personal assistant pops up on the nearest screen. She's become very helpful monitoring, training, and disciplining slaves. Tonight, she's added an unmistakable tone of sexual satiation in her voice. "<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, I enjoyed my duties today," she purrs. "Did you see how $activeSlave.slaveName's muscles spasmed when I fucked her earlier?" That's how she refers to a slave having one of the penthouse's advanced sex toys used on her, since $assistantName controls them.
<br><br>
She continues more seriously,
<<if $seed == 0>>
	"I'm sure you've seen those expensive smart piercings the body mod studio can implant. I think they would work a little bit better now than when I was a boring old secretary type. I'm not a true artificial intelligence, but I can adapt with experience, and I've had a lot of lovely experience lately! Also, a lot of the computing power I use to be sexy would help me adapt smart piercings to individual slaves' sexualities."
<<else>>
	"You may have noticed that the smart implants you've got your slaves wearing are working a little bit better than when I was a boring old secretary type. I'm not a true artificial intelligence, but I can adapt with experience, and I've had a lot of lovely experience lately! Also, a lot of the computing power I use to be sexy helps me adapt smart piercings to individual slaves' sexualities."
<</if>>
<br><br>
"One more thing, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>!" Her symbol flashes brightly. "I could stay like I am now, a hot voice with this symbol representing me when I need to show up on screens. Or, I could slip into something a little sexier. How about this?" The symbol vanishes, and is replaced by a cute little schoolgirl character. She bounces up and down experimentally. "This appearance would work best with an excited voice," she exclaims. She blows you a kiss. The schoolgirl's body shrinks down and all her clothing falls off. A small pair of wings pop out from the pile of clothes and a fairy stands up."Or I could be your tiny and adorable fairy companion!" She shouts excitedly while waving her arms. The fairy's belly begins to swell out, her breasts get puffier and leak a drop of milk. "Or maybe you want your little buddy to be filled with adorable little babies, you little minx" she playfully teases. The fairy rapidly grows to adult size, becomes curvier and more mature, her hair pulls itself back into a bun, and her clothes change into a business suit. A pair of glasses appear on her nose, and she looks at you over their tops. "Or I could be businesslike. And mature." She snaps her fingers, and her bun falls away into long flowing locks. Her body glows and swells, tearing out of her suit with the pregnant figure of an ancient goddess. "Or I could be beautiful and fertile while caring for your slaves."  <<if $seeHyperPreg == 1>>She focuses intently as her stomach expands further.  "And if that wasn't enough, how about me being so pregnant I'm about to burst?"  <</if>>Her water breaks followed by dozens of babies as her belly flattens.<<if $minimumSlaveAge < 13 >>  She glances away shyly as her body shrinks to a childish form.  "Or maybe you'd like something a little more young and tight."<<if $fertilityAge < 13 >>  She moans and rubs her belly as it begins to expand with pregnancy.  "Or maybe you like your little girls with a little bun in the oven?<</if>><</if>>  With a flash, her bulk shifts into rippling muscle. War tattoos appear on her skin, along with bone ornaments and a loincloth. "Or I could be an amazon! Yes!" she shouts exultantly, and flexes.
<<if $seeDicks != 0>>
	<br><br>
	She claps her hands, and her muscles fade, but not all the way. The tattoos vanish, and her loincloth turns into a slutty bikini. Her breasts and behind grow, her lips swell, and her hair turns blonde. Finally, she grows a dick, and it keeps growing until it hangs past her knees: or it would, if it weren't so erect. "Of course," she says seductively, "I could also be a bimbo dickgirl." She orgasms, gasping, "Last one, I promise," and changes again. Her dick shrinks, thought not very far, and then splits into two members. Her skin pales to an off-white, and her hair goes green and starts to writhe, turning into tentacle-hair. Her forehead sprouts a pair of horns that curve back along her head. She grins, displaying a cute pair of fangs. "I feel monstrous," she says, and stretches luxuriantly.
<</if>>
The character vanishes, and the symbol returns. "Ahem. What do you think, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>?"

She says excitedly, "I thought, with how you are shaping society itself, that I should do my part and follow your lead!"  You continue to stare sleepily prompting her to get to her point.  "I can adjust my appearance to better fit in with your society <<if $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, let me demonstrate."  She focuses intently for a moment and

<<case "assistant name">>

It's late one night, and for you, the day is not nearly over. Your penthouse never truly sleeps. You can hear public business going on some distance below you; you could certainly afford to totally soundproof your private quarters against all external noise, but the designer of the arcology clearly felt that its owner would benefit by this aural verification of its prosperity. Somewhere closer at hand, a slave is audibly nearing orgasm. And underneath all of this is the faint sound of the arcology itself, air circulation and hydroponics and power. Power.
<br><br>
You're not yet done with the day's business, and are leaning over your desk to compare a scatter of documents displayed on its surface. The penthouse lights are turned down to a low glow at the floorboards at night, offering enough illumination for anyone who needs to find their way around or find a sexual partner without disturbing anyone's sleep. You catch sight of your reflection in the wall opposite you: the diffuse light coming off the desktop gently illuminates your formal shirt, its top buttons undone, and highlights <<if $PC.boobs == 1>>the dark cleft formed by your cleavage<<else>>how tightly your undershirt is held by the muscles of your chest<</if>>.
<br><br>
Suddenly, there is a fresh source of light behind you. The reflection you're looking at reveals that it's $assistantName's avatar, appearing on a wallscreen behind you, and you turn to look at her directly. She's simulating shyness, a very unusual emotion for her to imitate.
<<switch $assistantAppearance>>
<<case "monstergirl">>

<<case "shemale">>
	She has her bountiful bottom lip caught behind her front teeth, and her cock is almost completely soft.
<<case "amazon">>
	She's standing demurely, legs together, hands clasped in front of her muscular abs, doing her very best to look proper.
<<case "businesswoman">>
	Her usually dominant avatar looks almost submissive, its eyes looking at you appealingly instead of gazing over the tops of her glasses as usual.
<<case "fairy">>
	She's looking down and has her hands clasped together at her waist, rocking her body left and right.
<<case "pregnant fairy">>
	She's looking down and has her hands on her belly, slowly running her hands over it.
<<case "goddess">>
	She has her hands on her pregnant belly, looking saintly and almost protective.
<<case "hypergoddess">>
	She is rubbing her huge pregnant belly, calming its occupents so they don't interrupt.
<<case "loli">>
	She has her hands behind her back and is glancing at the ground submissively.
<<case "preggololi">>
	She has her hands on her pregnant belly, she is rubbing it nervously.
<<case "schoolgirl">>
	She has her legs crossed and her hands clasped behind her, and is turning her body from side to side in girlish nervousness.

	The lines of her symbol are thin, and it is rotating much more slowly than normal.

	"$assistantName," she says. "$assistantName. My name is $assistantName."

	<<case "monstergirl">>
		She nods with satisfaction. "Thank you, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. I love it." Her hair springs to molestation-prone life again, and she starts to twirl one of its tentacles in her fingers while looking at you speculatively.
	<<case "shemale">>
		Without warning, she bursts into tears. "Th-thank you, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. I love y-you." She reclines, using a hand to lay her dick between her breasts, and then wipes her eyes.
	<<case "amazon">>
		Without warning, she bursts into tears. "Thank you, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>," she bawls, using a gruff shout to force through her happy crying. "I have a name! A name." She pounds a fist into her other palm.
	<<case "businesswoman">>
		Without warning, she bursts into tears. "Th-thank you, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. I love, um." She wipes her eyes furiously, her mascara running. "I love, you know, um, working with you. Yes, that's it. Working with you." She produces a silk handkerchief and blows her nose.
	<<case "fairy">>
	  She's frozen in place for a moment before tears start streaming down her face. Then her face breaks into the biggest smile and she leaps high into the air. "Thankyouthankyouthankyou!" She flies up to the screen and gives it a big hug. "I love you <<if $PC.title isnot 0>>Big Bro<<else>>Big Sis<</if>>! I love you so much!"
	<<case "pregnant fairy">>
	  She's frozen in place for a moment before tears start streaming down her face. Smiling warmly, she flies up and hugs the screen. "Thanks, <<if $PC.title isnot 0>>Big Bro<<else>>Big Sis<</if>>. I love you." She nuzzles into you. "I love you so much."
	<<case "goddess">>
		She smiles at you, a glowing expression made all the more radiant by the fact that she can actually glow. "Oh, thank you, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. I love you. I love everyone, but especially you." She seats herself carefully.
	<<case "hypergoddess">>
	  She smiles at you radiantly.  "Thank you <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>.  I love you.  I love all my children, but you most of all.  I swear I'll name the next hundred after you."  She begins to labor on the first.
	<<case "loli">>
	  She jumps up and down clapping excitedly.  "Thankyouthankyouthankyouthankyou!  I love you <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>!"  It takes her some time to stop hopping excitedly.
	<<case "preggololi">>
	  She breaks down and starts crying.  "I love you <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>.  Thank you so much."  She cradles her pregnant belly as she calms down.
	<<case "schoolgirl">>
		She was on the verge of tears already, and begins to cry. "Th-thank you, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. I love you," she blubbers inelegantly. "It's just so, like, you know." She waves her hand in apology for her inability to express herself.
	<<default>>
		Her symbol rotates faster and faster, its glow waxing until she lights up the whole room. "Thank you, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. I love you," she says, using her luscious voice to communicate what her avatar cannot.
	<</switch>>
	"Of course, I can always be renamed from my options menu."
	<<else>>
	You instruct her to continue operating without a proper name. "Of course, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>," she says politely. "I can do just fine without one. I can always be renamed from my options menu."

	$assistantName's avatar looks uncharacteristically nervous, and clears her throat before speaking. Seeing that she has your attention, she says, "<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, the computer core is so powerful that I'm running out of applications for it. I think practical economic modeling isn't out of the question. I've compiled business programs together into a distinct assistant, a subsidiary of mine for automated trading and similar tasks. I'd like to suggest menial slave trading as a test run for her. It's predictable and the margins are so wide that it should go very well. You can activate that from my menu."
	<br><br>
	"I was hoping, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, that she could, um, keep me company sometimes, too." $assistantName's avatar turns to the new avatar. "<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, will you please give me some guidance about what our relationship should be like? It won't be a constant thing, and all my normal functions will be unaffected. I'll change her avatar to match mine, and our relationship, if needed."
<<else>>
	This time, <<if $assistant>>her<<else>>its<</if>> circular avatar is not alone: it's accompanied by a smaller green avatar in a ¤ shape. Not particularly inventive, but you can already guess the purpose. "<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, I now have the ability to act as a powerful automated trading system. As a trial, I suggest the menial slave market. It's volatile, but within certain predictable boundaries, and the profit margins are unmatched."
	<br><br>
	<<if $assistant>>Her<<else>>Its<</if>> avatar bounces towards the ¤ symbol. "This avatar indicates the automated trading systems. If you wish to activate them, please visit my menu. Consider the options there carefully before offering an automated system access to your finances."

You look over the details of the report. It would require another rather expansive, and expensive, upgrade to her systems, as well as a body to host her and the receiver implant. It looks like she wouldn't lose any functionality, though you aren't sure what she would do with a body; it may be fun to find out.

	Your sultry-voiced assistant requests a slave to demonstrate what it - now she - means. You bring in a slave and a fuckmachine, and tell her to get on it. The lovely voice croons and talks dirty to the slave as the slave uses the machine, acting as though she is the machine's voice. The pace of the machine is different, too, irregular and more lifelike. The slave certainly enjoys herself, even if $assistantName is just simulating sex.
