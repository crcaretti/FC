You will have to acquire an additional 4% interest in $arcologies[0].name to take control of this sector. Such an interest is worth ¤$price and will require a transaction cost of ¤10000 to acquire for a total cost of ¤<<print $price+10000>>.

		You have so much political capital that you can spend reputation to acquire ownership by spending reputation. [[Use reputation|Main][$rep -= $repPrice, $arcologies[0].ownership += 4, $arcologies[0].demandFactor += 20, $sectors[$AS].ownership = 1]]

<<else>>
	Too much of the arcology is owned by a single minority holder for you to force a purchase of this sector right now. Your control of the arcology should naturally resolve this situation in a few weeks.
