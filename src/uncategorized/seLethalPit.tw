You review the rules - the combatants will use their choice of swords, and the fight will be to the death, with both combatants executed if no decision is reached. The winner will earn two complete days of rest, not to mention continued life. You take a moment to look over your girls before giving the word. After all, it's the last time you'll be seeing one of them alive.

Slowly, _winner.slaveName moves forward, waving her sword side to side in the hopes of finding her opponent before she herself gets found. _loser.slaveName's sword clips the tip of _winner.slaveName's setting off a surprisingly brutal series of slashes. The two slaves violently lay into each other, suffering more and more strikes as the struggle goes on. Less than a minute from first contact, both slaves are lying in their combined blood.

The stricken girl collapses, feebly trying to push her viscera back into place. Whether out of mercy or a desire to get it over with, _winner.slaveName quickly removes the dying girl's head.

		_winner.slaveName wants to win and is confident she will, but she isn't particularly sure about how to do so. She fights cautiously, swinging her sword in powerful but inaccurate strokes. It is only a matter of time before one of these strikes gets through; it's telling that rather than hitting what she aimed at, _winner.slaveName accidentally opens a massive gash down _loser.slaveName's thigh. Realizing she has to do something, _loser.slaveName makes a desperate counterattack, pouring blood as she goes. _winner.slaveName panics and fails to parry one of the last counterstrikes before loss of blood ends the attack, suffering a @@.red;terrible cut@@ to her shoulder. Down to one arm, _winner.slaveName is forced to make a long, loud butchery of ending the fight.

	Upon your word the two combatants approach each other warily, both knowing the other is reasonably competent. Before long they are trading thrust and parry, swing and block. _winner.slaveName is slowly pressed back, so she decides to change the nature of the fight. After three tries she manages to force _loser.slaveName to close, suffering a @@.red;nearly severed ear@@ as she does. _loser.slaveName realizes she only retains an advantage at long range but cannot back up fast enough to avoid close combat. _loser.slaveName is forced back fast enough that she trips; she's barely fallen on her back before she grunts with shock and pain, dying with a look of surprise as she stares at the sword growing out of her chest.

	_winner.slaveName realizes that _loser.slaveName's wingspan gives her a huge reach advantage. She bores straight in, taking @@.red;a glancing scalp wound@@ but coming on regardless. _loser.slaveName understands her opponent's intention and backs off, but the pit is small and there isn't much room to retreat. When her back hits a padded wall, _winner.slaveName aims a gutting cut that _loser.slaveName struggles to block. She manages it, but the wall catches her point, so the block is with her wrist, not her sword. The sharp blade cuts almost all the way through the joint, leaving her in agony and totally incapable of defense. _winner.slaveName pushes her head back against the wall and cuts her throat down to the spine.

	_winner.slaveName is so massively muscular that she's actually impeded by her lack of speed and flexibility. _loser.slaveName is properly afraid of her strength, though, so she tries to stay away as much as she can. The few times their blades clash reinforces this approach, since _winner.slaveName is able to beat her opponent's blocks out of the way with contemptuous ease. The fight takes a long, long time, but it takes more out of _loser.slaveName to survive than it takes out of _winner.slaveName to keep swinging. Eventually the gasping, weeping _loser.slaveName trips and does not struggle to her feet in time. It takes her tired opponent several overhead butcher's cleaves to end it.

The instant the fight starts, she quickly slices right across _loser.slaveName's massive belly, which is far too large to possibly defend. _loser.slaveName's belly ruptures like a popped water balloon, showering _winner.slaveName with

She hits the distracted girl's neck from the side, almost but not quite separating her head from her body.
