//The Gymnasium-Academy is a very unusual slave school. It sits at a bizarre juncture of the evolving gender roles and slave roles in the Free Cities. Its graduates are exclusively born male, and are not surgically or hormonally changed, but are thoroughly indoctrinated in the gender roles of the Free Cities to be accepting of their place in the new and rapidly changing world. Since the Gymnasium-Academy produces graduates with a greater ability to build muscle, fitness and virility than any of its competitors, it also trains for athletic perfection to further differentiate them. This training relies on traditional methods of corporal punishment. <<if $TGA.schoolUpgrade != 0>><br><br>Since you have endowed <<if $TGA.schoolUpgrade == 1>>advanced training methods at the Gymnasium-Academy, its graduates are now fanatically loyal.<<else>>a combat training center at the Gymnasium-Academy, its graduates are now deadly fighters.<</if>> As a major <<if $PC.title == 0>>benefactrix<<else>>benefactor<</if>> of the institution, you also receive a discount on them.<</if>>//
