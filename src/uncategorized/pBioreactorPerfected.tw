When you need peace and quiet to work through a difficult problem, you sometimes take a few minutes to pace through $dairyName. The massive, gently swaying breasts are always an encouraging sight, and the faint, rhythmic sounds of machine milking, machine feeding, and machine sodomy have a stimulating effect on one's thought processes. When you reach the end of the row of machines for the first time today, you turn to walk back again, and then notice that $assistantName's
