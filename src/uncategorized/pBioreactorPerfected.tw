When you need peace and quiet to work through a difficult problem, you sometimes take a few minutes to pace $dairyName. The massive, gently swaying breasts are always an encouraging sight, and the faint, rhythmic sounds of machine milking, machine feeding, and machine sodomy have a stimulating effect on one's thought processes. When you reach the end of the row of machines for the first time today, you turn to walk back again, and then notice that $assistantName's
<<if $assistant == 0>>

	"This slave is permanently dependent on her milking machine," it continues. "She cannot be removed without uneconomical expenditures, and is unlikely to be useful elsewhere.
	Additionally, there is nothing more that can be done to make her breasts any bigger<<if $activeSlave.balls > 5>> or her testicles any more productive<<elseif $activeSlave.ovaries == 1>> or her womb any more productive<</if>>. Her development is essentially final, and that status can be made official. She could be redesignated as equipment. Other than her designation, this would make little difference: the machine would be slightly less cautious with her drugs, future intubations, and such. She would be removed from the slave lists."

She's complete, and she's part of this machine now, and that's all she'll ever be. I can make that status official, <<if $PC.title == 1>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. I'd redesignate her as equipment. It wouldn't change much, other than a designation. I'd just be a little less cautious with her drugs, future intubations, things like that. But for slave purposes, she'd be gone. Just a part of $dairyName, forever.
