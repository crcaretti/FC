//The Growth Research Institute (GRI) is not primarily a slave school at all, but rather the world leader in female growth hormone development. It operates research centers in the Free Cities to avoid traditional medical research laws. GRI runs several slave schools to raise healthy, unmodified subjects for use in trials. After a year of experimental hormone treatment they are sold. <<if $GRI.schoolUpgrade != 0>><br><br>You have endowed <<if $GRI.schoolUpgrade == 1>>a research focus on advanced curatives, most subjects now leave the GRI at unnatural levels of vitality.<<else>>a research focus on milk production, subjects' breasts are bigger and milkier than ever.<</if>> As a major <<if $PC.title == 0>>benefactrix<<else>>benefactor<</if>> of the institution, you also receive a discount on them.<</if>>//

<br><br>GRI offers a fresh graduate for inspection via video call. The interview takes place in the graduate's bare-metal holding cell. Disturbingly, it is strongly reminiscent of an enclosure for a lab animal, only scaled up to contain a lab animal of human dimensions.
