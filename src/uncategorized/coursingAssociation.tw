You are a member of $arcologies[0].name's Coursing Association. Coursing is a Free Cities revival of the old sport of hunting rabbits and hares with sighthounds, with the typically Free Cities amendments that the hares are replaced by newly enslaved people, the sighthounds are replaced by trained slaves, and the killing of the hare is replaced by rape. Truly, a sport of gentlemen.
<br><br>The chasing slaves are known as lurchers, the term once used for the sighthounds. They require speed most of all, but must also be able to tackle their quarry; lurchers with the ability and willingness to make a spectacle of molesting the hares can improve their owners' reputations.

<<if $Lurcher != 0>>
