//The Slavegirl School is the newest slave school operating in the Free Cities. Its business model is to offer simpler, cheaper wares than its competitors. All Slavegirl School graduates are natural-born females without surgical modifications. Their training emphasizes elimination of any serious psychological deformities. They are promptly enslaved and sold as soon as they reach their majorities, and are marketed as complete virgins. <<if $TSS.schoolUpgrade != 0>><br><br>You have endowed <<if $TSS.schoolUpgrade == 1>>an alternative college at The Slavegirl School, which focuses on retraining good MILF stock into mature slave girls.<<else>>an improvement in the simplistic school's approach that teaches good basic skills without losing too much efficiency.<</if>> As a major <<if $PC.title == 0>>benefactrix<<else>>benefactor<</if>> of the institution, you also receive a discount on them.<</if>>//

The Slavegirl School offers a fresh graduate for inspection via video call. The interview takes place in a faculty member's office. Absurdly, it's barely distinguishable from an office at any traditional institution of higher education. The only giveaway is the profusion of sex toys on the desk and the pornography on the walls.
