	<br><br>The Fuckdoll suit's systems connect to the arcology and run a full systems check. The reports waterfall down the nearest wallscreen, moving from the top of the Fuckdoll down. The simple brain activity sensor is showing elevated readings as $activeSlave.slaveName desperately tries to find $his bearings.
	<<if $activeSlave.hLength > 20>>The twin tails of hair sticking out of the suit material that covers $his scalp are waving from side to side slightly as $he struggles.<</if>>

	<<if $activeSlave.voice == 0>>$His breath rushes in and<<else>>Incoherent moans are coming<</if>> out of $his <<if $activeSlave.lips > 95>>facepussy<<else>>mouth insert<</if>>.
	The suit can stimulate every intimate area that it covers with vibration, electrostimulation, warmth, and cold, and $activeSlave.slaveName must be in agony as it tests these systems.

	<br><br>The suit includes a network of small tubes filled with hydraulic fluid, and tiny pumps to move it around. This is necessary to keep the Fuckdoll's internal temperature stable, but it can also be used to restrict its movements. The suit is doing so now; the Fuckdoll is desperately attempting to move, but the suit won't let it.
	<<if $activeSlave.amp == 0>>
		It's rocking back and forth slightly on its heeled boots, which are designed for stability.
	<<else>>
		<<if $activeSlave.amp < 0>>Its P-Limbs have been removed, since they aren't compatible with Fuckdoll suits.<</if>>
		The Fuckdoll's limbless torso rocks back and forth slightly.
	<</if>>
	The heart rate reading is so high that the Fuckdoll is receiving drugs to calm it down and prevent damage; the suit can deliver these and any other necessary pharmaceuticals by intravenous shunt. Farther down, on the Fuckdoll's side over its ribcage, there are a pair of metal ports. These allow it to be fed.
	<<if $activeSlave.belly > 1500>>The suit does not cover its <<if $activeSlave.bellyPreg > 1500>>pregnant<<else>>rounded<</if>> belly, which is allowed to protrude from a hole in the material.<</if>>

	<br><br>The Fuckdoll's rear hole is extremely eye-catching from behind, since it's the only area of skin visible from that angle across its body, which is a featureless expanse of dull latex-like material.
	<<if $activeSlave.vagina > -1>>From its other side, its front hole stands out likewise.<</if>>
	<<if $activeSlave.dick > 0>>Its penis has its own pouch in the material.<</if>>
	The Fuckdoll continues to struggle. Since it is new, it is not yet able to obey the tonal command system the suit uses to transfer orders to its inhabitant, who cannot otherwise hear. It will have to learn by painful experience, and eventually, that is all it will know.

<<case "fuckdollExtraction">>
	If you were expecting a great return to humanity after extracting $him from $his Fuckdoll suit, you're to be disappointed.
	<<if $activeSlave.eyes != 0>>

	<</if>>
	<<if $activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken">>
		$His mind remains just as broken outside the suit as it was inside it. In many ways, $he's as much of a living sex toy now as $he was when $he was a Fuckdoll; $he's unresponsive to almost everything, though $he will probably still understand how to get fucked. $His personality is probably somewhere back there in the Fuckdoll maintenance areas, like the scraps of the suit that was just cut off $him. Just another piece of refuse.
	<<elseif $activeSlave.fuckdoll > 20>>
		Though $he retains possession of some of $his faculties, $he's been severely affected by the weeks $he's spent as a living sex toy. Any joy or relief at being liberated from the Fuckdoll suit is probably being suppressed by the similarity of the extraction procedure to the routine suit maintenance $he received weekly. If $he even understands that $he's been freed, $he's been trained so thoroughly that $he will struggle to adapt to life more complex than tonal commands and sexual use.
	<<else>>
		Though $he hasn't been a Fuckdoll long enough to be permanently damaged, $he's so emotionally exhausted by everything $he's experienced over the past few weeks that $he betrays no relief or joy, or even any fear that $he'll be turned into a Fuckdoll again. $His posture bespeaks something like apathy. $He should reawaken gradually, but for now $he's still actively remembering how to live as a human, rather than as a living sex toy.
