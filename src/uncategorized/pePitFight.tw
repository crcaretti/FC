It's time for the fight. It will take place in a back room of a well respected club. There is a ring set into the floor, and space for a handful of spectators, but the setup is quite Spartan. The sport is just getting off the ground. <<EventNameLink $activeSlave>> is first to walk into the ring. She's stark naked and is carrying a simple single-edged straight sword, identical to the one her opponent will be using. The fight will be fair.

<<if $activeSlave.pregKnown == 1 || $activeSlave.bellyPreg >= 1500>>
	<<if $activeSlave.bellyPreg >= 750000>>
		Her monolithic pregnancy guarantees her loss; not only is she on the verge of splitting open, but it is an unmissable, indefensible target that threatens to drag her to the ground. She has no hope of attacking around the straining mass, let alone stopping her opponent.

	<<if $activeSlave.bellyImplant >= 750000>>
		Her monolithic, <<print $activeSlave.bellyImplant>>cc implant filled belly guarantees her loss; not only is she on the verge of splitting open, but it is an unmissable, indefensible target that threatens to drag her to the ground. She has no hope of attacking around the straining mass, let alone stopping her opponent.
	<<elseif $activeSlave.bellyImplant >= 600000>>
		Her titanic, <<print $activeSlave.bellyImplant>>cc implant filled belly is practically a guaranteed loss; she can barely stand let alone fight. Not only is it crippling heavy, unwieldy and an easy target, but she can feel it straining to hold the sheer amount of filler forced into it.

	<</if>>
<</if>>

<</if>>

Finally, her opponent enters as well.

<<set $seed = random(1,100)>>
<<if $seed > 80>>
	She is a huge, muscular Amazon filled with confidence.
	<<set $opponent = 5>>

The umpire announces gravely that the fight is to the death and rings a bell.

<<nobr>>

<<if $deadliness > ($opponent + 1)>>
	$activeSlave.slaveName senses that she is greatly superior, and decides to make a quick end before her opponent can try something foolish. She feints high and stabs low; her enemy just manages to parry the low stab, but is so much weaker that $activeSlave.slaveName simply overpowers her, so that she falls onto her back with the force of the clash. $activeSlave.slaveName takes one step forward and runs her sword through the prostrate slave's heart. This victory has @@.green;won you some renown@@ and @@.yellowgreen;a sum of money@@ from each of the spectators.
	<<set $rep += 500>>
	<<set $cash += 5000>>
	<<set $activeSlave.pitKills += 1>>
	<<set $pitKillsTotal += 1>>
<<elseif $deadliness > ($opponent)>>
	The combat is long and exhausting. $activeSlave.slaveName and her opponent are closely matched in terms of skill, so neither takes foolish risks and a protracted, bloody fight results as both slaves take horrible but non-lifethreatening cuts. Finally, $activeSlave.slaveName's superior physical condition wins out and her opponent falls from exhaustion and blood loss. $activeSlave.slaveName stumbles over to open her throat. This victory has @@.green;won you some renown@@ and @@.yellowgreen;a sum of money@@ from each of the spectators, though $activeSlave.slaveName is @@.red;badly hurt.@@

<<elseif $deadliness > ($opponent-1)>>
	The combat is long and exhausting. $activeSlave.slaveName and her opponent are closely matched in terms of skill, so neither takes foolish risks and a protracted, bloody fight results as both slaves take horrible but non-lifethreatening cuts. Finally, $activeSlave.slaveName's inferior physical condition fails her and she falls from exhaustion and blood loss. As she slumps she catches your eye with a look of apology. Her opponent stumbles over to open her throat. $activeSlave.slaveName @@.red;has been killed.@@
	<<set $activeSlave.health -= 1000>>
<<else>>
	$activeSlave.slaveName is outmatched from the start. In the first pass, her opponent moves beyond her, opening a long gash in her thigh as she goes. Thus injured, $activeSlave.slaveName fails to block a slash that severs her Achilles tendon on the other side. On her knees, she barely manages to ward off one more blow before the second one opens her belly. $activeSlave.slaveName @@.red;has been killed.@@
