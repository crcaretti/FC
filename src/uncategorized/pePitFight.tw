It's time for the fight. It will take place in a back room of a well respected club. There is a ring set into the floor, and space for a handful of spectators, but the setup is quite Spartan. The sport is just getting off the ground. <<EventNameLink $activeSlave>> is first to walk into the ring. $He's stark naked and is carrying a simple single-edged straight sword, identical to the one $his opponent will be using. The fight will be fair.

	<<elseif $activeSlave.bellyImplant >= 600000>>
		$His titanic, <<print $activeSlave.bellyImplant>>cc implant filled belly is practically a guaranteed loss; $he can barely stand let alone fight. Not only is it crippling heavy, unwieldy and an easy target, but $he can feel it straining to hold the sheer amount of filler forced into it.

	<<set $opponent = 1>>
<</if>>

The umpire announces gravely that the fight is to the death and rings a bell.

<br><br>

<<if $deadliness > ($opponent + 1)>>
	$activeSlave.slaveName senses that $he is greatly superior, and decides to make a quick end before $his opponent can try something foolish. $He feints high and stabs low; $his enemy just manages to parry the low stab, but is so much weaker that $activeSlave.slaveName simply overpowers her, so that she falls onto her back with the force of the clash. $activeSlave.slaveName takes one step forward and runs $his sword through the prostrate slave's heart. This victory has @@.green;won you some renown@@ and @@.yellowgreen;a sum of money@@ from each of the spectators.
	<<set $rep += 500>>
	<<set $cash += 5000>>

<<elseif $deadliness > ($opponent)>>
	The combat is long and exhausting. $activeSlave.slaveName and $his opponent are closely matched in terms of skill, so neither takes foolish risks and a protracted, bloody fight results as both slaves take horrible but non-lifethreatening cuts. Finally, $activeSlave.slaveName's superior physical condition wins out and $his opponent falls from exhaustion and blood loss. $activeSlave.slaveName stumbles over to open her throat. This victory has @@.green;won you some renown@@ and @@.yellowgreen;a sum of money@@ from each of the spectators, though $activeSlave.slaveName is @@.red;badly hurt.@@

	The combat is long and exhausting. $activeSlave.slaveName and $his opponent are closely matched in terms of skill, so neither takes foolish risks and a protracted, bloody fight results as both slaves take horrible but non-lifethreatening cuts. Finally, $activeSlave.slaveName's inferior physical condition fails $him and $he falls from exhaustion and blood loss. As $he slumps $he catches your eye with a look of apology. $His opponent stumbles over to open $his throat. $activeSlave.slaveName @@.red;has been killed.@@
	<<set $activeSlave.health -= 1000>>
<<else>>
	$activeSlave.slaveName is outmatched from the start. In the first pass, $his opponent moves beyond $him, opening a long gash in $his thigh as she goes. Thus injured, $activeSlave.slaveName fails to block a slash that severs $his Achilles tendon on the other side. On $his knees, $he barely manages to ward off one more blow before the second one opens $his belly. $activeSlave.slaveName @@.red;has been killed.@@
