The day that wasn't supposed to come is here. The troubled little country next door is falling apart. Last month, its stock market collapsed. Last week, its government fell. Yesterday, there was open looting in its cities. And today, a faction of disaffected citizens that blames the Free Cities for siphoning off business and causing the collapse seized weapons from unguarded army depots<<if ($terrain == "marine") || ($terrain == "oceanic")>>, armed merchant ships and private vessels, and are approaching the Free City over the water<<else>> and advanced towards your home<</if>>.

<br><br>

Sirens are blaring; there is a crump far above as $arcologies[0].name's defensive systems knock down one of the first mortar rounds fired into the Free City. The lights in your office changed to a harsh emergency scheme as soon as the attack became a certainty.

It's going well. Whoever's in command of the attackers sees that their fire is having no effect, and orders an advance. The mortars and other artillery systems maintain their fire, trying to occupy as many guns as possible.

<br><br>

The loose militia lately organized by the arcology owners has been called out to defend the city. Its commander, seeing that the attackers have more passion than tactical skill, orders an immediate counterattack by anyone able<<if ($terrain == "marine") || ($terrain == "oceanic")>> to push the invaders landing in the dock areas back into the sea<</if>>. Technology has advanced to the point that rich militiamen who buy their own gear can form a powerful fighting force. With luck, the counterattack should shatter the enemy.
