The nonconformist
<<if $FSNonconformist == "Pastoralist">>
	has long been a vocal skeptic of the tastefulness of grown citizens drinking milk from slaves' breasts. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against pastoralism. They're planning to publish an exposee that purports to reveal abuses in the human milk industry.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Supremacist">>
	is a hardline egalitarianist who believes that all men are created equal, even if some then become slaves. They themselves are $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace, and they insist on flaunting their $arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace slaves. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against $arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace supremacism. After a brutal but deserved public punishment of a $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace slave by one of the group of concerned citizens, the nonconformist is planning on visiting the same horrors on one of their $arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace slaves, on a very weak pretext.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Subjugationist">>
	is a hardline egalitarianist who believes that all men are created equal, even if some then become slaves. They themselves are $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace, and they insist on flaunting their non-$arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace slaves. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace inferiority. After a brutal but deserved public punishment of a $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace slave by one of the group of concerned citizens, the nonconformist is planning on visiting the same horrors on one of their non-$arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace slaves, on a very weak pretext.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Repopulation Efforts">>
	has long been skeptical of the point of your repopulation efforts when the world is not stable and the arcology only so big. They plan to publish information regarding overpopulation, the negatives of chain pregnancies, the dangers of inbreeding and the risks of having so high a concentration of slaves.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Eugenics">>
	has recently knocked up his favorite pet, and instead of responsibly aborting the bastard, has freed and married her. Allowing such actions to come to the publics attention will create a huge scandal and massive trouble for the Societal Elite, as well as undoing much of the progress you've made towards a better future.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Gender Radicalist">>
	has never been quiet about their belief that slaves with dicks are not girls. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against gender radicalism. They've purchased a highly feminized slave one of the group of concerned citizens sold to a third party, and are rumored to be returning the slave to her natural state. The oligarchs are worried that they plan to publicize this project, or worse, possibly even free the slave.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Gender Fundamentalist">>
	has never been quiet about their belief that anything with an asshole counts as a slave girl. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against gender traditionalism. They've been accumulating a number of sexually skilled slaves with dicks, and the oligarchs are worried that some sort of public event involving free sex with these slaves is planned to sway lower class opinion.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Paternalist">>
	has never been shy about their belief that true trust between slave and master is impossible. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against paternalism. They're rumored to run a household in which slaves are required to beat miscreants without mercy or be savaged themselves. There are indications that they may intend to make these spectacles public.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Degradationist">>
	has never been shy about their belief that slaves are people too, and should be treated with respect. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against degradationism. They're rumored to allow their slaves to decline sex. This perversion is bad enough, but the oligarchs are concerned that they may intend to take this practice public, setting favored slaves up with their own apartments and livelihoods.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Body Purist">>
	has always been known for their harem of implant-filled silicone dolls. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against body purism. They've purchased a wonderfully healthy and pure slave one of the group of concerned citizens sold to a third party, and it's rumored that the slave has been outfitted with cutting-edge gradually expanding breast implants with no effective maximum size. The oligarchs are disgusted and mortified lest this project become public.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Transformation Fetishist">>
	has always been known for their harem of natural girls. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against transformation. They've purchased a heavily implanted slave one of the group of concerned citizens sold to a third party, and it's rumored that the slave is being painstakingly returned to her natural, implant-free appearance. The oligarchs are concerned that the nonconformist may be planning some sort of public reveal of her naturalist makeover.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Slimness Enthusiast">>
	has always been known for their harem of disgusting hambeasts. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against the fashion for slimness. They've purchased a notoriously graceful slave one of the group of concerned citizens sold to a third party, and it's rumored that the slave is being force fed in private as preparation for some kind of insulting public reveal. The oligarchs are mortally offended without even seeing the final product.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Asset Expansionist">>
	has always been known for their harem of disgusting beanpoles. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against the fashion for big tits. They've purchased a slave with famously magnificent boobs one of the group of concerned citizens sold to a third party, and it's rumored that the slave has undergone a radical breast reduction as preparation for some kind of insulting public reveal. The oligarchs are mortally offended without even seeing the final product.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Youth Preferentialist">>
	has never missed an opportunity to share their belief that a mature woman who knows her way around a dick is a better fuck than a virgin. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against the fashion for youth and freshness. They're holed up in their luxurious apartments, preparing a large number of older, sexually experienced slaves for something big. The oligarchs suspect that some sort of event involving free sex may be planned to sway lower class opinion.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Maturity Preferentialist">>
	has never missed an opportunity to share their belief that a fresh girl is infinitely preferable to an old whore. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against the fashion for maturity and experience. They're holed up in their luxurious apartments, preparing a large number of virgin slaves for something big. The oligarchs suspect that some sort of event involving free sex may be planned to sway lower class opinion.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Physical Idealist">>
	rarely misses a chance to lecture on the perils of toxic masculinity and excessive public standards of beauty. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open revolt against the Valhalla of physical perfection the arcology is rapidly becoming. They're rumored to be preparing a manifesto on beauty at any size, along with the necessary funds to bribe neutral third parties into going along.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Chattel Religionist">>
	originally moved to the Free Cities to get away from religion entirely, and has never missed a chance to register disdain for the new faith. Unfortunately, it seems that they've now edged over into open heresy. Typically, they're going about it in a hypocritical way. It's rumored that they've engaged the services of a charismatic itinerant preacher of one of the more popular old world faiths, and intend to bring him to the arcology to inveigh against the chattel religion.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Roman Revivalist">>
	has been a longtime skeptic of historical revivalism, publicly deploring it as a childish game of dress-up. This never got much traction, since Rome has become quite fashionable here. Frustrated, they're rumored to be planning a change of approach. Despairing of getting the population to give up the Roman project, they're going to set up a competing Gaulish Revivalism. The quixotic effort is almost certainly doomed to fail, but the oligarchs fear it will be a distraction.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Edo Revivalist">>
	has been a longtime skeptic of historical revivalism, publicly deploring it as a childish game of dress-up. This never got much traction, since Edo Japan has become quite fashionable here. Frustrated, they're rumored to be planning a change of approach. Despairing of getting the population to give up the Japanese project, they're going to set up a competing Korean Revivalism. The quixotic effort is almost certainly doomed to fail, but the oligarchs fear it will be a distraction.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Arabian Revivalist">>
	has been a longtime skeptic of historical revivalism, publicly deploring it as a childish game of dress-up. This never got much traction, since the golden age of the Caliphate has become quite fashionable here. Frustrated, they're rumored to be planning a change of approach. Despairing of getting the population to give up the Arabian project, they're going to set up a competing Byzantine Revivalism. The quixotic effort is almost certainly doomed to fail, but the oligarchs fear it will be a distraction.
<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Chinese Revivalist">>
	has been a longtime skeptic of historical revivalism, publicly deploring it as a childish game of dress-up. This never got much traction, since ancient China has become quite fashionable here. Frustrated, they're rumored to be planning a change of approach. Despairing of getting the population to give up the imperial project, they're going to set up a competing Mongol Revivalism. The quixotic effort is almost certainly doomed to fail, but the oligarchs fear it will be a distraction.

	has been a longtime skeptic of historical revivalism, publicly deploring it as a childish game of dress-up.

Despairing of getting the population to give up the Egyptian project, they're going to set up a competing Ancient Greek Revivalism.

The nonconformist is far too prominent and prosperous to make this an easy dilemma to resolve. Your societal goals are at stake, as is your reputation among some of your best citizens, but the nonconformist has significant sway in the arcology's economy. Merely forcing them out of the arcology would damage its prosperity, and more decisive action could have more serious consequences still.

	<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Arabian Revivalist">>
		offers their Byzantine Revivalism alternative with fanfare, but jihad may be waged with diplomacy as much as with the sword. The nasty little attempt founders on the growing conservatism of the arcology, whose citizens rally to you as their proper leader.
	<<elseif $FSNonconformist == "Chinese Revivalist">>
		offers their Mongol Revivalism alternative with fanfare, but judicious strengthening of your imperial authority sees it off without trouble. The influence of Confucian ideas is spreading through your arcology, making it resistant to radical departures.

	Resolving the situation takes you one call. Exactly what happened to your predecessor as owner of the arcology has never become publicly known, but your method of replacing them is rumored to have been somewhat ballistic in nature. It doesn't take much inflection in your voice to communicate threat, and the nonconformist hastily promises to abandon their plans and be less annoying in the future. The oligarchs are somewhat frightened by the rapidity with which you sorted things out, but they can't argue with the results and their @@.green;respect for you deepens.@@
