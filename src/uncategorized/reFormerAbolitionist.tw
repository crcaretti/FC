Crime is extremely rare in $arcologies[0].name, and some would say justice rarer still, but if there's one thing that unites the citizens of $arcologies[0].name, it's a mutual outrage towards attempted abolitionists. Slave ownership is the cornerstone of the society that protects and enriches them, and they see those who would attempt to unlawfully free slaves not just as thieves of property but as anarchists trying to bring down everything they have worked to build.

While a brutal flogging or surgical mutilation soothes their outrage, nothing warms the collective heart of $arcologies[0].name's mob like the sight of a former abolitionist well and truly broken. <<EventNameLink $activeSlave>> is one such shining example, and her borderline worship of you is doing wonders for your reputation lately as she becomes a local celebrity and a popular topic of discussion.

This is a rare opportunity. While the mob is quick to pat itself on the back for withstanding attacks from abolitionists, before long they will tire of remembering those dangers and turn their attention elsewhere. It might be possible, with a serious investment of funds in publicity, to really fix her in the public mind as a shining example of your slave-breaking prowess.

You fasten $activeSlave.slaveName in a kneeling position in the center of your club, secured by shackles around her wrists and ankles - purely decorative, since she's so devoted she'd perform her role in this if you just hinted it would please you if she did.

The world is in love with $activeSlave.slaveName.
