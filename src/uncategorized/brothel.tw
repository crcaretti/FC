$brothelNameCaps
<<switch $brothelDecoration>>
<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
	is decorated as a Roman whorehouse. Refreshments are served at a bar, and someone is playing pipes in the back.
<<case "Aztec Revivalist">>
	is decorated as an Aztec ode to fertility and nature. Clients may sacrifice a bit of blood to honor the goddess of Filth or to partake in a fertility ritual before joining the girl of their choosing.
<<case "Egyptian Revivalist">>
	is decorated as an ancient Egyptian fertility temple. Customers are bade relax on couches next to running water so that slaves may dance to entice them.
<<case "Edo Revivalist">>
	is furnished as an Edo period pleasure house, seedy by the standards of the time. Still, girls usually keep their clothes on until they lead patrons back behind the sliding paper screens, though this does not stop silhouettes of the activities within from being visible on them.
<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>
	is furnished as an Arabian fleshmarket, with the merchandise standing on little platforms, prices visible. Customers are permitted to fondle before making a decision and dragging a girl back behind a curtain.
<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
	is furnished as an old Chinese pleasure house, with each girl set up in her own low room. They stand outside the doors, luring customers back one by one.
<<case "Chattel Religionist">>
	is decorated as a place of carnal worship. The air is scented by censers, and the slaves here maintain an air of holiness even when being sodomized in public.
<<case "Degradationist">>
	is decorated to look like a dungeon. The decor involves a lot of black leather and burnished steel, and the slaves on offer are mostly chained to beds and walls.
<<case "Repopulation Focus">>
	is clean and full of soft couches and chairs for its' pregnant whores to lounge upon while showing off their assets. Several of the rooms are prepped to allow a whore to give birth in front of an audience. A supply of freshly squeezed breast milk is available on tap.
<<case "Eugenics">>
	is decorated to look like a club. Loud music is playing, and the whores that aren't with customers are stripping and poledancing on a stage. Safe sex is greatly encouraged. The real action happens in several reserved rooms dedicated to society's best, since the loud music drowns out private conversations.
<<case "Asset Expansionist">>
	is decorated to look like a club. Loud music is playing, and the whores that aren't with customers are stripping and poledancing on a stage.
<<case "Transformation Fetishist">>
	is sterile and clean. Interactive screens on the walls list the whores and their modifications in clinical detail.
<<case "Gender Radicalist">>
	is decorated to look like an old world bordello. The rich decor includes erotic photography and pornographic statuary, depicting every possible combination of human sexual congress.
<<case "Gender Fundamentalist">>
	is decorated to look like an old world whorehouse. Screens on the walls are showing pornography starring the whores, with prices flashing after each sex act.
<<case "Physical Idealist">>
	is decorated to look like a club. Loud music is playing, and the whores that aren't with customers are stripping on a stage. There is a distinct smell of sweat, and there is as much emphasis on the strippers' muscles as their breasts.
<<case "Supremacist">>
	is decorated like an old world gentleman's club. The pictures on the wall depict degradation of every race on earth, except $arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace people.
<<case "Subjugationist">>
	is decorated to celebrate the degradation of $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace whores. The whores greet customers in stereotypical $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace accents.
<<case "Paternalist">>
	is decorated to look like a trendy bar. Whores are encouraged to meet customers for a drink and get to know them a little before heading back into a private room.
<<case "Pastoralist">>
	is decorated to look like a dairy. Though it isn't one, there is an intense sexual focus on boobs and lactation, and all the whores have their sizes and productivity proudly posted.
<<case "Maturity Preferentialist">>
	is decorated to look like a refined bar. It has a row of sturdy backless barstools, perfect for a delectable selection of succulent MILFs to perch on.
<<case "Youth Preferentialist">>
	is decorated to look like the sort of bar old world students visit on spring break. Vapid music is playing, and when whores aren't with customers, they dance and make out with each other to attract some.
<<case "Body Purist">>
	is decorated to look like an old world bordello. The rich decor includes erotic photography and pornographic statuary, depicting idealized human forms in the act of love.
<<case "Slimness Enthusiast">>
	is decorated to look like an old world bordello. The rich decor includes erotic photography and pornographic statuary, depicting slim, girlish figures playing, dancing, and loving.
<<case "Hedonistic">>
	is comfortable and full of soft couches and chairs for its' overweight whores to lounge upon between clients <<if $arcologies[0].FSHedonisticDecadenceResearch == 1>>and enjoy a plate of snacks<<else>>and enjoy a big cup of slave food<</if>>. The smells of fresh baked goods are pumped into the facility to mask the smell of sweat. It's not unusual for a client to fuck a whore right on her chosen couch, since the effort of moving is often too much.
<<default>>
	is utilitarian. There's a businesslike foyer with an area for the merchandise to stand. Customers make their selection (or selections) and then lead the whores back into little rooms.
