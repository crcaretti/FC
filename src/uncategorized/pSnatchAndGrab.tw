<<if $assistantName is "your personal assistant">>Your personal assistant<<else>>$assistantName<</if>> forwards a discreet message from the leader of your mercenaries.
<br><br>
"<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, I've just become aware of a... business opportunity through some old friends. There's an unregistered lab doing illegal gene therapy work. At least two agencies are onto them, which is how I heard of it. Word is, they're packing up and moving out. I believe me and my people can appropriate that shipment. Catch is, to make this work I need to pay some serious bribes, and I need to pay them today. We'll cut you in as an equal partner for Â¤10000 cash, right now. One share should come to one of the lab rats, more or less. Are you in or out?"

	<<if $assistantName is "your personal assistant">>Your personal assistant<<else>>$assistantName<</if>>'s $assistantAppearance avatar appears on your desk next to the message.
	<<if $assistantAppearance is "monstergirl">>
		"I vote yes. Even though whatever that lab is producing can't possibly be as interesting as me," she says haughtily, and twirls a strand of tentacle hair.
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "shemale">>
		"I vote yes," she says sweetly. "Whatever they're doing, it's probably interesting. I'd love to fuck something interesting."
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "amazon">>
		"I vote yes!" she shouts. "Whatever they're doing, their girls are probably valuable. And everything's more fun if you loot it instead of buying it."
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "businesswoman">>
		"I vote yes," she says. "The likelihood that the lab is producing something valuable is overwhelming. The potential profits are," and she pauses to fan herself, "exciting."
	<<elseif ($assistantAppearance is "fairy") or ($assistantAppearance is "pregnant fairy")>>
		"I vote yes," she says. "They could be up to something really cool!"
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "goddess">>
		"I vote yes," she says. "Whatever is in that lab deserves some loving attention and... more variety is always appreciated."
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "hypergoddess">>
		"I vote yes," she says. "Whatever is in that lab deserves some loving attention and... more variety is always appreciated."
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "loli">>
		"I vote yeah," she says. "I wanna see whats inside!"
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "preggololi">>
		"I vote yeah," she says. "I wanna see whats inside!"
	<<elseif $assistantAppearance is "schoolgirl">>
		"I vote yeah," she says. "I just wanna see what that lab is doing. Could be cool!"
	<<else>>
		"I would suggest agreement," she says. "Even if the prize does not appeal to you personally, she's likely to be quite valuable. Selling her could net you quite a profit."
