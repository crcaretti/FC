<<switch $clinicDecoration>>
<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
	is open and airy; a breeze wafts through the space, and Roman theories on natural cleanliness are very much on display.
<<case "Aztec Revivalist">>
	is open and airy; a light hint of herbs and natural oil permeates the air. Everything is incredibly sterile, especially the blood management equipment.
<<case "Egyptian Revivalist">>
	is open and airy; clean rushes are strewn across the floor, making a gentle susurration when anyone crosses the space.
<<case "Edo Revivalist">>
	is clean and spartan to the point of featurelessness. Spotless tatami mats cover the floor, and partitions divide the space into cubicles.
<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>
	is open and airy; a thin trail of smoke wafts through the space on a gentle breeze, coming from a brazier burning incense.
<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
	is open and airy; a thin trail of smoke wafts through the space on a gentle breeze, coming from a brazier burning medicinal herbs.

<<case "Transformation Fetishist">>
	is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available centimeter of space is used for equipment specialized to support radical surgery.
<<case "Gender Radicalist">>
	is comfortable and feminine. Its curving walls and soft colors are designed to present slaves coming out of anaesthesia with an impression of girlishness.
<<case "Gender Fundamentalist">>
	is comfortable and feminine. Its curving walls and soft colors are designed to keep slaves here for their female health nice and comfortable.
<<case "Physical Idealist">>
	is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available centimeter of space is used for some piece of equipment useful in making the human body faster or stronger.
<<case "Supremacist">>
	is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. The only hint of its radical uses are the pseudoscientific racialist charts on the walls.
<<case "Subjugationist">>

<<case "Hedonistic">>
	is warm and comfortable, with extra wide, soft, heated beds and ample morphine. Pleasant smells are pumped into the recovery wards, plenty of entertainment is available and chubby nurse in a too small dress with a big bowl of slave food is only a button press away. It can be quite difficult to convince patients to leave.

	is a well-equipped modern medical facility. Each patient has her own area, with heavy automation to provide her treatment without any human intervention at all.

		The entire floor beneath $clinicName is occupied by a huge filtration plant that constantly cycles out the patients' blood to remove impurities. The blood is intensely cleaned to greatly decrease the presence of impurities at the cost of compatibility. Patients will likely be ill for the duration of the treatment.

<<if $bellyImplants == 1 && $Nurse == 0>>
	A resident nurse could be used to safely regulate the rate a slave's fillable belly implant for maximum size with minimum health loss.
<<elseif $bellyImplants == 1 && $clinicInflateBelly == 1>>
	$clinicNameCaps is useful for keeping slaves healthy during long term procedures. Slaves in $clinicName with inflatable belly implants will be filled during their time under $Nurse.slaveName's supervision to maximize growth with minimized health complications. [[Do not fill belly implants|Clinic][$clinicInflateBelly = 0]]
<<elseif $bellyImplants == 1 && $Nurse != 0 && $clinicInflateBelly != 1>>
	$clinicNameCaps is useful for keeping slaves healthy during long term procedures. $Nurse.slaveName can supervise weekly filling regiments for clinic slaves with fillable belly implants during their stay to maximize growth with minimal health complications. [[Fill belly implants|Clinic][$clinicInflateBelly = 1]]

<<if $pregSpeedControl == 1 && $Nurse == 0>>
	A resident nurse could be used to supervise patients under rapid gestation agents while minimizing strain and health complications.
<<elseif $pregSpeedControl == 1 && $clinicSpeedGestation == 1>>
	It's exceedingly dangerous to speed up gestation without constant supervision. In $clinicName, $Nurse.slaveName will monitor slaves on rapid gestation agents; making sure the growing patients' food demands are met, monitoring their skin and womb and, if need be, perform an emergency c-section should the need arise. [[Limit rapid gestation agents to selected slaves only|Clinic][$clinicSpeedGestation = 0]]
<<elseif $pregSpeedControl == 1 && $Nurse != 0 && $clinicSpeedGestation != 1>>
