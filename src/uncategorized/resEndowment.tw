<<if $RESEndowment == "TSS">>
	You receive a personal call from a senior representative of The Slavegirl School. It seems the school is raising funds, and since you've already <<if $TSS.schoolPresent == 0>>purchased $TSS.studentsBought of its graduates<<else>>encouraged them to open a branch campus in your arcology<</if>> and are known to be wealthy, you are an obvious potential donor. Though the Free Cities' slave schools are of course for-profit institutions, they do their best to maintain a veneer of public service, and cast their efforts to improve their product as a benefit to slaveowning society as a whole.
	<br><br>
	"A generous donation," the representative insists, "would help us advance our mission to provide good quality slaves at competitive prices." Getting down to the business advantages, he adds that "donors receive considerable price advantage on future graduates," which seems to translate into a discount of around 20% once the sales language is stripped off it. You point out that's bordering on pointlessness to you, given your ability to purchase almost anything you wish; he hesitates, but then admits that "as our foremost supporter" you could use an endowment to guide school policy to an extent.
<<elseif $RESEndowment == "GRI">>
	You receive a personal call from a senior representative of the Growth Research Institute. It seems the institute is raising funds, and since you've already <<if $GRI.schoolPresent == 0>>purchased $GRI.studentsBought of its test subjects<<else>>encouraged them to open a branch campus in your arcology<</if>> and are known to be wealthy, you are an obvious potential donor.

	"A generous donation," the representative insists, "would help us advance our mission to truly make the 21st century the century of biology." Getting down to the business advantages, he adds that "donors receive considerable price advantage on future transactions," which seems to translate into a discount of around 20% once the sales language is stripped off it.

	"A generous donation," the representative insists, "would help us advance our mission to provide the very finest companions to persons of quality such as yourself."

<<else>>
	You receive a personal call from an older member of the Futanari Sisters. Like all of the Sisters, she's very beautiful, but you know how to judge age through the most cutting-edge treatments, and you guess she's in her early forties. That makes her one of the most senior Sisters, at the age when mandatory enslavement will happen very soon for her. She doesn't seem preoccupied by the prospect, though the pair of gorgeous young women cooperating to suck off her enormous cock may have something to do with that. "<<print $PCName>>," she says forthrightly,
	<<if ($PC.dick == 1) && ($PC.vagina == 1) && ($PC.boobs == 1)>>
		"You've become quite famous among us.
	<<else>>
		"$TFS.studentsBought of my Sisters have left us for you. You seem interested in us, and are clearly very wealthy.
	<</if>>
	I would like to ask you for help." She explains that a schism is developing within the Sisters over whether the ideal futanari should have balls. "This is a serious matter," she says. "We must agree on our goals. I believe a futa's pussy is most exquisite without testicles to obscure it." She stands up, displacing her attendants and bringing her genitalia into view. She has scarcely a trace of scrotum. "Sadly, removal of our balls would reduce our ability to remain erect, and reduce our sex drives. So, the solution is clearly to carefully calibrate our transformations to ensure that our testicles never descend, like mine; or if they have descended, to reverse that with surgery. With your support, I can make this vision predominate. I hope," she says, turning to give one of her attendants a tender kiss, "that this will make us more loving, as well."
	<br><br>
	Scarcely has the call ended than another comes in. It's another matron of the Futanari Sisters; she looks so much like her Sister that you are momentarily confused. "I know what my Sister said, and I know what she asked for," she purrs. She manipulates the video call controls, zooming the camera out. It reveals that she has her equally enormous cock in a much younger Sister's pussy; another attendant is lavishing oral attention on her testicles, which are comically big. "She's wrong. We are more beautiful with balls, and the bigger, the better." She shudders, pulling out to blow a gigantic load all over all three of them. Her erection does not waver for an instant as she transfers it to the other futa's anus. "We are sexually superior like this, too. Lust is better than love. Support me instead, I beg you."

	<<link "Reorient the school to MILF training">>
		<<replace "#result">>
			You pause measuringly before forwarding facts and figures to the surprised representative. You matter-of-factly prove the school's shortsightedness in focusing on young slaves; it's a field with a lot of competition and brutal overhead. There's potential elsewhere: MILFs. They're never virgins and they go for lower prices, but their skills can be advanced without ruining them, and material costs are lower. After furious internal debate, the school agrees to your suggestion. The grateful school spreads @@color:green;word of your generosity,@@ using you as an example of investment in the future of slaveowning.

		<<replace "#result">>
			You express your interest in the institute's curative research. The representative admits the field is notoriously difficult, but readily agrees that the institute could certainly focus on health to a greater extent than it already does; its surviving test subjects will probably leave testing programs at a unique level of vitality.

			You introduce your plans to the representative by forwarding the records of the GRI test subjects you've purchased and what you've done with them. His eyes widen at the profitability you've found in use of their already-impressive breasts to produce milk. The institute readily agrees to pursue the field by focusing more heavily on lactation and breast expansion.

			You express general satisfaction with previous graduates on a physical level, but mention exasperation with the unfortunate tendency of some of them to question their place in life. You crossdeck a series of research reports that outline a method of reducing any girl to idiotic devotion. The representative is dubious, since it will reduce prices, but you point out the potential for commensurately reduced overhead, and the school eventually agrees.

			You state general satisfaction with previous graduates, but express some regret that the hormonal treatments that feminize the school's products tend to impact certain amusing parts of their anatomy. The representative is dubious, since that minimization is a major part of the school's brand, but you wax rhapsodic on the advantages of a well-endowed bottom kept soft by hormones, and the school eventually agrees.

She reports that the future of the Futanari Sisters is decided; every effort will be made to keep their balls as unobtrusive as possible. "The younger Sisters," she says approvingly, "seem more submissive and caring already." She has a pretty young futa in her lap, nibbling one of her elder's ears. "My opponent," the matron continues, "will not be available for enslavement, if you're wondering." She looks smug. "We have decided that since she suffers from an excess of concern for ejaculation, she will serve the rest of us as a cum producer. The way we have her restrained is similar to an industrial arcology dairy." She reaches offscreen, taking up a glass full of ejaculate. "This is hers," she says, and drains it. Mulling the taste, she looks thoughtful. "Hm," she says. "The taste isn't perfect, but if we improve that, it might reduce the volume. Though we could always increase the size of her anal stimulation to counteract that."

She reports that the future of the Futanari Sisters is decided; every effort will be made to grow their balls as big as possible. "The younger Sisters," she says approvingly, "seem hornier already." She has a pretty young futa in her lap, bouncing lustily on her elder's cock. "My opponent," the matron continues, "will not be available for enslavement, if you're wondering." She looks smug. "We have decided that since she suffers from a lack of concern for ejaculation, she will serve the rest of us as a milk cow. The way we have her restrained is similar to an industrial arcology dairy." She reaches offscreen, taking up a glass full of creamy milk. "This is hers," she says, and drains it. Mulling the taste, she looks thoughtful. "Hm," she says. "The taste isn't perfect, but if we improve that, it might reduce the volume. Though we could always increase her dosage of breast expansion drugs to counteract that."
