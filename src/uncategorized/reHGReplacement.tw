There's a constant traffic of slaves in and out of your office as girls come in for instructions, inspections, and sex. Your Head Girl $HeadGirl.slaveName is one of the most frequent visitors, since although you trust her, she's still a slave and has to check with you before acting on some matters.<<if $HeadGirl.relationship == -3>> (She's also your wife, making her visits a pleasant diversion.)<<elseif $arcologies[0].FSEgyptianRevivalistLaw == 1>> (She's also your Consort, making her visits a pleasant diversion.)<</if>> During one of her visits, <span id="name"><<print "[[$activeSlave.slaveName|Long Slave Description][$nextLink = passage(), $eventDescription = 1]]">></span> happens to come in for her scheduled inspection. She perches politely on the couch, waiting her turn like a good girl. Her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes are watchful, however, and she seems to be paying very close attention to your conversation with your Head Girl.

When $HeadGirl.slaveName leaves, she clears her throat nervously. She gathers her courage, and

	lisps, "<<if def $PC.customTitleLisp>>$PC.customTitleLisp<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Mathter<<else>>Mithtreth<</if>>,

<</if>>
 I think I would make a better Head Girl than her." She takes a deep breath and plunges on. "I'm

	<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>>. Please, give me a chance."
<</if>>
She goes on like this for a while, slowly degenerating into repetition of her points as your failure to give her an immediate positive or negative response starts to worry her.

	After giving the matter some consideration, you agree, instructing $assistantName that $activeSlave.slaveName is now the Head Girl. $activeSlave.slaveName is @@color:hotpink;overjoyed,@@ and bounces to her feet, clearly very eager to begin. You caution her that she is not to undermine $HeadGirl.slaveName by letting anyone know why you decided to change Head Girls. She nods obediently. As far as $HeadGirl.slaveName knows, it's just a standard change of Head Girls, and she's too good a slave to let it affect her seriously.

	You pretend you didn't hear her, and go about your business. She quickly catches on, and shuts her mouth, sitting stiffly on the couch and waiting for you to say something. After letting her wait for a good long while, you steeple your fingers and look over them at her. She quails at your gaze, but does not look away from you. You tell her that, for her general information, you prefer to make decisions about what slaves do which job yourself, and are not interested in input from the slaves themselves on the matter. You continue to observe that if any slave were to offer input, she might suggest to you that she thought her own judgment superior to yours. Then, you dismiss her.

	You page $HeadGirl.slaveName, telling her to get back up to your office. $activeSlave.slaveName hears you, of course, and stiffens with fear. She knows she's in trouble, but she doesn't yet know how much. You tell $HeadGirl.slaveName to have a seat next to $activeSlave.slaveName on the couch, and instruct $assistantName to replay the last five minutes of the feeds from your office on a wallscreen. $activeSlave.slaveName's<<if $activeSlave.lips > 40>> pillowlike<</if>> lower lip begins to tremble at this, and she can barely manage to keep her gaze on the fatal replay of her attempt to convince you to replace $HeadGirl.slaveName with her. $HeadGirl.slaveName, who is no fool, is not surprised by this, but the replay still angers her. As it rolls on, her hands begin to roam across $activeSlave.slaveName, who winces at her touch. About halfway through, $HeadGirl.slaveName looks straight at you and cruelly pinches one of $activeSlave.slaveName's nipples. You respond to the nonverbal question with a silent nod, and $HeadGirl.slaveName smiles briefly at you. Then, she sticks her tongue in $activeSlave.slaveName's ear. The poor slave starts at the warm, wet intrusion, but knows better than to try to resist. She closes her eyes tight.
	<br><br>
	$HeadGirl.slaveName hops off the couch, gets down in front of her victim, and shoves her legs apart. $activeSlave.slaveName scrunches up her face, expecting something agonizing to happen to her <<if $activeSlave.dick == 0>>pussy, but $HeadGirl.slaveName shocks her by starting to hungrily eat her out.<<else>>cock, but $HeadGirl.slaveName shocks her by giving her a lush blowjob.<</if>> $activeSlave.slaveName clearly expects a trap, but $HeadGirl.slaveName's attentions slowly distract her.

	<<else>>

	<</if>>
	Then she goes back to giving $activeSlave.slaveName oral. $activeSlave.slaveName begins to cry, realizing how comprehensively fucked she is.
	<br><br>
	Eventually, she climaxes. $HeadGirl.slaveName has a talented tongue. $HeadGirl.slaveName does not begrudge the slave her pleasure, <<if $activeSlave.dick == 0>>tonguing her clit all the way through her orgasm.<<else>>industriously sucking her cock until she's swallowed every last drop of cum.<</if>> She stands up and seizes $activeSlave.slaveName by the ear,

	$activeSlave.slaveName's weeping stopped during her climax, but now she starts to @@color:gold;sob with terror,@@ and she cries harder as your Head Girl hauls her out of your office by her ear. $HeadGirl.slaveName @@color:mediumaquamarine;waves cheerfully@@ to you as she leaves with her victim.
