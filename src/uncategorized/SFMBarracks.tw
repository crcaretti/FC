//The barracks of <<textbox "$securityForceName" $securityForceName "SFM Barracks">> is located in the lower levels of $arcologies[0].name, occupying unneeded warehouse space. It is not accessible to the general citizenry, but your personal elevator has express service to it. As you step off, two soldiers in combat armour manning the entry checkpoint tense and raise their weapons, before nodding respectfully and stepping aside, allowing their patron entry. The barracks is cavernous, containing areas for the soldiers to sleep and keep their belongings, areas for the storage and maintenance of their weapons and equipment, and common areas for them to amuse themselves, since they rarely mix with your citizens on the upper levels. You survey the facilities.//

<br><br>
<<include "SpecialForceUpgradeDec">>
<br><br>

//You continue towards the common area, the soldiers you pass nodding respectfully, saluting, or giving slight bows, as they please, to you. You pass the briefing areas, the officers and sergeants of the force are conferring over planning tables and display screens regarding their upcoming deployments.//

<br><br>

<div style="margin-left:2em">
<<if $securityForceFocus == "recruit">>
	The commanders are viewing lists of potential recruits for $securityForceName, mercenaries and Old World soldiers who might be receptive to an offer of employment and residence within the arcology. In addition to some citizen's of $securityForceName who wish to have some excitement in their lives.
<<elseif $securityForceFocus == "secure">>
	The commanders are reviewing maps of trade routes to the arcology as well as those nearby merchant hubs, arranging their future deployments to best protect them and encourage business and trade.
<<elseif $securityForceFocus == "raiding">>
	The commanders are reviewing maps of settlements and locations reported to have choice concentrations of material loot and potential slave stock, in preparation for their coming raids.
<</if>>
</div>

<div style="margin-left:2em">
<<if $securityForceRulesOfEngagement == "hold">>
	There are posted (and very strict) guidelines for the use of force against non-citizens residents, forbidding the use of heavy weapons or indiscriminate fire.
<<elseif $securityForceRulesOfEngagement == "limited">>
	There are some guidelines posted regarding the use of force against non-citizens, forbidding general indiscriminate fire.
<<elseif $securityForceRulesOfEngagement == "free">>
	Guidelines regarding the use of force are completely absent from the deployment information screens. A note affixed to the screen, probably from a soldier, says: "Pop 'em if you see 'em - better than target practice!". Another one on top of that, from The Colonel, says: "Don't shoot the pretty ones, you fucking morons, or I'll kill you myself. They're worth good money or good for fun - do you idiots really want to have to fuck month-old stock?"
<</if>>
</div>

<div style="margin-left:2em">
<<if $securityForceAccountability == "strict">>
	On several screens, there are prominent warnings regarding the severe disciplinary procedures that will be taken against soldiers who commit crimes while on deployment.
<<elseif $securityForceAccountability == "some">>
	On several screens, there are some minor warnings regarding the mild disciplinary procedures that may be taken against soldiers who commit especially severe crimes while on deployment.
<<elseif $securityForceAccountability == "none">>
	There are no warnings or information regarding disciplinary procedures on any of the screens. Near one of them, a waste basket has been dragged over and a soldier has posted a note above it that says: "For Old World Complaints and Warrants."

//You arrive at the barracks' common area, a nest of bars, pleasure dens, public spaces, and other facilities catering to the soldiers' needs and giving them somewhere to spend their free time, since they do not mingle with your citizens on the higher levels or exit the arcology except on deployment. It is well-occupied by the soldiers not currently tasked with duties, and they respectfully move out of your way as you approach, clearing a path for you to move forward.//

<<if $securityForceDepravity <= 0.3 && $ColonelCore == "kind">>
	The amenities are staffed by menial slaves, captured by the soldiers on their excursions. They are wearing plain jumpsuits and slim identification collars to set them apart from the soldiers, and look resigned but not fearful. The soldiers themselves socialize at the bars, in small groups around tables, and in the gambling parlours. Many of them can be seen entering or leaving the dens occupied by the sexual slaves they have acquired. Laughter from the carousing soldiers can be heard at all times. Small groups of slaves move freely between the plaza and their basic accommodations attached to the barracks.
<<elseif $securityForceDepravity <= 0.6 && $ColonelCore == "kind">>
	The amenities are staffed by menial slaves, captured by the soldiers on their excursions. They are topless, wearing only utilitarian pants and leather collars to set them apart from the soldiers, and occasionally shoot fearful looks at the soldiers. The soldiers themselves socialize at the bars, or in large groups around tables, leering at and groping slaves of interest as they pass by. Many of them can be seen entering or leaving the dens occupied by the sexual slaves they have acquired, and often emerge only partially dressed, sometimes pulling half-naked slaves out with them.
<<elseif $securityForceDepravity <= 0.9>>
	The amenities are staffed by menial slaves, captured by the soldiers on their excursions. They are topless, wearing only utilitarian shorts and steel collars to set them apart from the soldiers, and often shoot fearful looks at the soldiers. The soldiers themselves socialize at the bars, or in large groups around tables, leering at and heavily groping slaves of interest as they pass by. Many of them can be seen entering or leaving the dens occupied by the sexual slaves they have acquired, and often emerge stark naked, sometimes pulling naked slaves out with them for one last servicing in public. A few soldiers stagger around in drunken hazes or drugged-out stupors.
<<elseif $securityForceDepravity <= 1.2>>
	The amenities are staffed by menial slaves, captured by the soldiers on their excursions. They are topless, wearing only a single undergarment and heavy steel collars to set them apart from the soldiers, and often shoot fearful looks at the soldiers. The soldiers occupy themselves primarily with sex, pulling slaves onto benches and fucking them hard in public. Many soldiers stagger around or lie passed out from drug and alcohol abuse.
<<elseif $securityForceDepravity >= 1.5 && $ColonelCore == "Warmonger" || $ColonelCore != "Shell Shocked">>
	The amenities are staffed by menial slaves, captured by the soldiers on their excursions. To a one, they are naked, and are wearing heavy shock collars to force obedience. Most are wild-eyed with fear or dull-eyed from mental collapse, and many others bear marks of abuse. Few of the slaves are here long-term, the depraved pleasures of the soldiers resulting in enormous turnover and loss of 'damaged' stock. The extreme libations of the soldiers are ever-present. Drunken soldiers stagger around everywhere, beating slaves too slow to get out of their way. Others lie sprawled out on the ground, rendered senseless from heavy drug abuse. Some walk around naked, and hold slaves down on the benches scattered around, raping or sodomizing them with their cocks or their personal strap-ons as they desire. In alcoves, some soldier-lover pairs fuck loudly, moaning in pleasure.
	<<if random(1,100) > 50>>
		Off to the side, a group of soldiers brutally gangbang a very young slave girl, with one soldier buried balls-deep in her ass, another brutally sawing a barbed strap-on in and out of her pussy, and a third with his cock forced deep down her throat. The slave girl struggles and gags, desperate for breath or relief.
	<<elseif random(1,100) > 50>>
		Off to the side, a group of soldiers cackle amongst themselves as they take turns beating a very young slave girl with heavy batons. Sickening crunches can be heard from the screaming slave.
	<<elseif random(1,100) > 75>>
		Off to the side, still more soldiers crowd around an above-ground pit built from empty crates, gambling on slave gladiator fights. There's a drunken cheer as one of the fighters, a very young slave girl, straddles another one and smashes her face in with a blood-slick ammo crate. As she stands, shaking from fear and adrenaline, one of the soldiers laughs and throws a small incendiary grenade at her, changing the cheers to curses as the other soldiers jump away from the flaming, screeching slave.
	<<else>>
		Screams and cries of pain can be heard echoing around the area as the soldiers have their fun with their property.

//In the middle of the common area is a pile of supply crates with a pavilion on top - The Colonel's personal throne and open quarters, the result of her preferring to live an extreme lifestyle amongst her soldiers rather than in her empty quarters on the upper levels. It's draped with the 'flag' of $securityForceName, one of her inventions. Sprawled all around it is an immense quantity of; alcohol, hard drugs,clothes, electronic devices, huge amounts of cash, jewels and precious metals looted from the outside world.//

	_Name raises a hand in greeting and nods as you approach. She is sprawled on a couch, wearing only her combat suit tank top and fingerless gloves. She's holding a near-empty bottle of strong liquor in her hand and you can see a naked slave girl kneeling on the floor between her legs. The Colonel has her legs wrapped tightly around the girl's head, forcing the girl to service her if she wants to breathe. The Colonel is close to her climax then suddenly tenses her lower body thus gripping the girl even tighter and throws her head back in ecstasy as she orgasms. She lets out a long breath finally releasing the girl, giving her a hard smack and shouting at her to fuck off.<br><br> The Colonel finishes off her bottle, tossing it over her shoulder then leaning back on the couch and spreading her legs wide. You look down briefly, falling into your habits of inspection. Her pussy is completely devoid of hair with heavy labia in with a very large and hard clit peaking out. Beads of moisture are visible, the result of her excitation and you can tell from long experience that she would be tight as a vise. You return your gaze to her face to find her smirking at you. "Like what you see, boss?" She waves her hand at the plaza around her, "So do they. But you're not here for pussy. You're here to talk business. So, what's up?"
<<elseif random(1,100) > 50>>
	_Name is in no condition initially, to greet you. She's naked except for one sock that gives you a very good view of her muscled, taut body while lunging with her feet on the table and the rest on her couch. She is face down in a drugged-out stupor in the middle of a wide variety of powders and pills. Perhaps sensing your approach, her head suddenly shoots up and looks at you with unfocused, bloodshot eyes. "Sorry, boss," she slurs, wiping her face and weakly holding up a hand. "Hold on a second, I need something to help me out here. Long fucking night." She struggles to sit on the couch and bending over the table, loudly snorts up some of the white powder on it. "Ahhh, fuck," she says, breathing heavily.<br><br> She shakes her head powerfully now looking at you, her eyes once again alert and piercing. "That's better," she says, leaning back on the couch and giving you another good view of her assets. "So, boss," she begins, "what brings you down here to our little clubhouse? I trust you're happy with how we've been handling things out there?" You nod. "excellent" she laughs. "I have to say, it's nice to have a place like this while having some top-end gear and to be able to have fun out there without worrying about anyone coming back on us. Good fucking times." She laughs again. "So - I'm assuming you want something?"
<<elseif random(1,100) > 70 && $securityForceDepravity >= 1.5>>
	_Name is relaxing on her couch stark naked, greeting you with a raised hand. Between her tightly clenched legs is a slave girl being forced to eat her out. "Hey, boss, what's -" she breaks off as a flash of pain crosses her features. "Fucking bitch!" she exclaims, pulling her legs away and punching the slave girl in the face. She pushes the girl to the ground, straddling her then begins hitting. You hear one crunch after another as The Colonel's powerful blows shatter the girl's face. She hisses from between clenched teeth, each word accompanied by a brutal punch. "How. Many. Fucking. Times. Have. I. Told. You. To. Watch. Your. Fucking. Teeth. On. My. Fucking. Clit!" She leans back, exhaling heavily. Before leaning back down to grip apply pressure onto the girl's neck with her powerful hands. Wordlessly, she increases the pressure and soon the girl begins to turn blue as she struggles to draw breath. Eventually her struggles weaken and then finally, end.<br><br> The Colonel relaxes her grip then wipes her brow, clearing away the sweat from her exertion. Finally rising from the girl's body, relaxing back on the couch and putting her feet back up on the table. "Sorry about that boss," she says, shrugging. "So many of these bitches we pick up from the outside don't understand that they have to behave." Shaking her head in frustration, "Now I need to find another one. But that's not your problem, you're here to talk business. So, what's up?"
<<else>>
	_Name is topless while reviewing the particulars of her unit on a tablet as you approach. She raises a hand in greeting. "Hey boss," she says, noticing you looking at her chest. She laughs. "Nice, aren't they? But they're not for you or them." She throws a thumb at the plaza around her. "You're down here for a reason, though. What can I do for you?"
