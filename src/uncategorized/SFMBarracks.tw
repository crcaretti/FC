//The barracks of <<textbox "$securityForceName" $securityForceName "SFM Barracks">> is located in the lower levels of $arcologies[0].name, occupying unneeded warehouse space. It is not accessible to the general citizenry, but your personal elevator has express service to it. As you step off, two soldiers in combat armour manning the entry checkpoint tense and raise their weapons, before nodding respectfully and stepping aside, allowing their patron entry. The barracks is cavernous, containing areas for the soldiers to sleep and keep their belongings, areas for the storage and maintenance of their weapons and equipment, and common areas for them to amuse themselves, since they rarely mix with your citizens on the upper levels. You survey the facilities.//

Drunken soldiers stagger around everywhere, beating slaves too slow to get out of their way. Others lie sprawled out on the ground, rendered senseless from heavy drug abuse. Some walk around naked, and hold slaves down on the benches scattered around, raping or sodomizing them with their cocks or their personal strap-ons as they desire. In alcoves, some soldier-lover pairs fuck loudly, moaning in pleasure.

As she stands, shaking from fear and adrenaline, one of the soldiers laughs and throws a small incendiary grenade at her, changing the cheers to curses as the other soldiers jump away from the flaming, screeching slave.

She's holding a near-empty bottle of strong liquor in her hand and you can see a naked slave girl kneeling on the floor between her legs. The Colonel has her legs wrapped tightly around the girl's head, forcing the girl to service her if she wants to breathe. The Colonel is close to her climax then suddenly tenses her lower body thus gripping the girl even tighter and throws her head back in ecstasy as she orgasms. She lets out a long breath finally releasing the girl, giving her a hard smack and shouting at her to fuck off.<br><br> The Colonel finishes off her bottle, tossing it over her shoulder then leaning back on the couch and spreading her legs wide. You look down briefly, falling into your habits of inspection. Her pussy is completely devoid of hair with heavy labia in with a very large and hard clit peaking out. Beads of moisture are visible, the result of her excitation and you can tell from long experience that she would be tight as a vise. You return your gaze to her face to find her smirking at you. "Like what you see, boss?" She waves her hand at the plaza around her, "So do they. But you're not here for pussy. You're here to talk business. So, what's up?"

She is face down in a drugged-out stupor in the middle of a wide variety of powders and pills. Perhaps sensing your approach, her head suddenly shoots up and looks at you with unfocused, bloodshot eyes. "Sorry, boss," she slurs, wiping her face and weakly holding up a hand. "Hold on a second, I need something to help me out here. Long fucking night." She struggles to sit on the couch and bending over the table, loudly snorts up some of the white powder on it. "Ahhh, fuck," she says, breathing heavily.<br><br> She shakes her head powerfully now looking at you, her eyes once again alert and piercing. "That's better," she says, leaning back on the couch and giving you another good view of her assets. "So, boss," she begins, "what brings you down here to our little clubhouse? I trust you're happy with how we've been handling things out there?" You nod. "excellent" she laughs. "I have to say, it's nice to have a place like this while having some top-end gear and to be able to have fun out there without worrying about anyone coming back on us. Good fucking times." She laughs again. "So - I'm assuming you want something?"

"Hey, boss, what's -" she breaks off as a flash of pain crosses her features. "Fucking bitch!" she exclaims, pulling her legs away and punching the slave girl in the face. She pushes the girl to the ground, straddling her then begins hitting. You hear one crunch after another as The Colonel's powerful blows shatter the girl's face. She hisses from between clenched teeth, each word accompanied by a brutal punch. "How. Many. Fucking. Times. Have. I. Told. You. To. Watch. Your. Fucking. Teeth. On. My. Fucking. Clit!" She leans back, exhaling heavily. Before leaning back down to grip apply pressure onto the girl's neck with her powerful hands. Wordlessly, she increases the pressure and soon the girl begins to turn blue as she struggles to draw breath. Eventually her struggles weaken and then finally, end.<br><br> The Colonel relaxes her grip then wipes her brow, clearing away the sweat from her exertion. Finally rising from the girl's body, relaxing back on the couch and putting her feet back up on the table. "Sorry about that boss," she says, shrugging. "So many of these bitches we pick up from the outside don't understand that they have to behave." Shaking her head in frustration, "Now I need to find another one. But that's not your problem, you're here to talk business. So, what's up?"
