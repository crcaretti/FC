//The barracks of <<textbox "$securityForceName" $securityForceName "SFM Barracks">> is located in the lower levels of $arcologies[0].name, occupying unneeded warehouse space. It is not accessible to the general citizenry, but your personal elevator has express service to it. As you step off, two soldiers in combat armour manning the entry checkpoint tense and raise their weapons, before nodding respectfully and stepping aside, allowing their patron entry. The barracks is cavernous, containing areas for the soldiers to sleep and keep their belongings, areas for the storage and maintenance of their weapons and equipment, and common areas for them to amuse themselves, since they rarely mix with your citizens on the upper levels. You survey the facilities.//
