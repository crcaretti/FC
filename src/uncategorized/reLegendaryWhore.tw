The Free Cities red light areas are so overcharged with cheap and easy sex that the fashion in whores is comically unstable. This week, <span id="name"><<print "[[$activeSlave.slaveName|Long Slave Description][$nextLink = passage(), $eventDescription = 1]]">></span> is in vogue. So many customers are interested in renting her body that it's necessary to assign other girls to take some of the load off her by diverting less important customers away from her.

<br><br>

This is a rare opportunity. Such popularity and fame is here today, and gone tomorrow. It might be possible, with a serious investment of funds in publicity, to really fix her in the public mind as a whore of note. There's no guarantee of success, but if you are successful, her value will increase a great deal.
