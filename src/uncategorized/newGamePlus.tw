You have decided to start over. You'll be able to take a few things with you: a few slaves, a small fraction of your current reserves of money, and possibly even your experience as an arcology owner, which will give you a very powerful career background. Many of your other customizations and settings will be carried over as the defaults for your new game, but can be revised freely.
<br><br>
You have the funds to bring $slavesToImportMax slaves with you (or your equivalent) to a new arcology.
<<if $cash >= 50000+($slavesToImportMax*10000)>>
	It will cost <<print cashFormat(50000+($slavesToImportMax*10000))>> to insure another slave's safe transfer. You have <<print cashFormat($cash)>> to spend.
	<br>[[Increase minimum transferred slaves by 1.|New Game Plus][$cash -= (50000+($slavesToImportMax*10000)), $slavesToImportMax++]]
<<else>>
	You lack the funds to bring more than $slavesToImportMax slaves with you (or your equivalent) to a new arcology. It would cost <<print cashFormat(50000+($slavesToImportMax*10000))>> to guarantee another's safe transfer.
