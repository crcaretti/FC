			$He looks pensive when you offer $him a one year supplementary indenture. The price reflects the market, and is a reasonable compensation for a year of sexual slavery. $He accepts it after some consideration, and you transfer the money into an escrow account to be held for $him until $his new indenture is done. Your sex slave once again, $he awaits orders with complacency.

$He makes no effort at all to conceal $his joy at being a free woman again. It seems very unlikely that $he'll stay in the arcology; $he'll probably take what remains of $his indenture payment, held in escrow for this day, and be off to wherever it is that $he came from in the first place.
