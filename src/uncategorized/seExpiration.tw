<<if $activeSlave.fetish == "mindbroken">>

Since she is mindbroken, there is precisely no chance that she will be able to look after herself. She stands before you dumbly, betraying no reaction to the prospect of becoming free from sexual slavery. In situations like this, it is perfectly acceptable to subject her to another indenture for her own good.

	You plead necessity and place her under another indenture, paying the trivial fees left over once she has been charged for her own forecasted upkeep. Naturally, she offers no response at all to any of this.

She has been trying desperately hard not to think about this trying situation, but when she comes before you on the day of her indenture's expiration, she can ignore it no longer. She

	wriggles disconsolately, probably wishing she could throw herself at your feet or cling to your knees.

	She does her best to communicate an earnest desire to stay, and repeats over and over that she loves you. She begins to indicate a willingness to accept true, unlimited slavery, if that's what it takes to stay.

	<<nobr>>
	She's beside herself with joy when you accept her plea and enslave her. She's given you the finest proof of loyalty a slave possibly can, having tasted a moment of freedom under the law, and thrown it away with utter contempt. Her $activeSlave.eyeColor eyes watch you with eager anticipation, radiating gladness that the prospect of separation from you has gone.

Her feelings on this are quite mixed, since she has come to feel that she has a place under you.

	She smiles almost shyly when you offer her a one year supplementary indenture. The price is reasonable, but definitely favorable to you. She accepts it anyway, and you transfer the money into an escrow account to be held for her until her new indenture is done. Your sex slave once again, she awaits your pleasure without a hint of fear.

She approaches the moment with calculation, since she has found more of a place in slavery than she probably expected when she became an indentured servant.

	She looks pensive when you offer her a one year supplementary indenture. The price reflects the market, and is a reasonable compensation for a year of sexual slavery. She accepts it after some consideration, and you transfer the money into an escrow account to be held for her until her new indenture is done. Your sex slave once again, she awaits orders with complacency.

<<else>>

She makes no effort at all to conceal her joy at being a free woman again. It seems very unlikely that she'll stay in the arcology; she'll probably take what remains of her indenture payment, held in escrow for this day, and be off to wherever it is that she came from in the first place.
