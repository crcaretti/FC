<span id="name"><<print "[[$activeSlave.slaveName|Long Slave Description][$nextLink to passage(), $eventDescription to 1]]">></span> is standing for an inspection. She's a good girl, and is cooperating, but she seems preoccupied. After ignoring it for a while, you give in to curiosity and flatly ask her what's going on.

	"I'm thorry, <<if def $PC.customTitleLisp>>$PC.customTitleLisp<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Mathter<<else>>Mithtreth<</if>>," she lisps, biting her lip. "It'th $subSlave.slaveName."

<</if>>
She hesitates, so you prompt her, asking if she's having trouble with her
<<if $activeSlave.relationship is 2>>

She quickly shakes her head no.

	"N-no, <<if def $PC.customTitleLisp>>$PC.customTitleLisp<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Mathter<<else>>Mithtreth<</if>>, it's jutht -"
<<else>>
	"N-no, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>>, it's just -"
<</if>>
She subsides into silence again, blushing and staring at her feet. Comprehension dawning, you ask her if
<<if $activeSlave.relationship is 2>>
	she wants to be more than friends with $subSlave.slaveName.
<<elseif $activeSlave.relationship is 3>>
	she's wanting to bring emotions into relationship with $subSlave.slaveName, rather than keep it friendly and sexual.
<<elseif $activeSlave.relationship is 4>>
	she wants to make an honest woman out of $subSlave.slaveName.
<</if>>
She nods her head quickly, still staring at her feet. She shuts her eyes tight and waits for you to weigh in on the situation.

	In a cold tone of voice, you admit your irritation with this schoolgirl nonsense, and tell her she's to stop spending time with $subSlave.slaveName. She's unable to prevent her eyes from flicking up at you in @@color:mediumorchid;shock and horror,@@ but she instantly lowers them again, the tears coming fast. You dismiss her, and she turns to go, but is so discombobulated by anguish that she trips over her own feet and falls with a slap of naked $activeSlave.skin flesh against the floor.
