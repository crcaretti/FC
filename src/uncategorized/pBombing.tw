One fine day, you're strolling down the main promenade, making your usual combined inspection and public rounds. These walks are triply useful, since they allow you to keep a finger on the pulse of your demesne, identify any problems, and display yourself to the population. <<if $Bodyguard != 0>>$Bodyguard.slaveName is walking with you, of course, her presence protection, intimidation, and ostentation, all in one.<</if>>

<<if $assistantName == "your personal assistant">>Your personal assistant<<else>>$assistantName<</if>> suddenly relays a silent alarm, highlighting a scruffy individual twenty meters ahead. This person is hooded and acting oddly. You catch a glance from beneath the hood in your direction: and the figure obviously decides that it can get no closer to you. Your assistant's scanning detects the presence of an implanted bomb moments before the suicide bomber detonates themselves.

The implant is small, and went off too far ahead to do anything more than stun. <<if $Bodyguard != 0>>Since she was behind you, $Bodyguard.slaveName is in much better shape than you, her ears clear and her senses sharp. <</if>>Three other assailants run at you from where they were waiting in the confusion, wielding improvised weapons that apparently did not set off the security scanners.

	$Bodyguard.slaveName glances at you to check that her principal is alive, her P-Limbs already entering combat mode. She becomes more inhuman by the moment,

	Your bodyguard's enhancements are not exactly secret, however, and the attackers are numerous, sent to overwhelm her. She drops her weapon, ammunition expended, producing a scream of triumph from one of the few remaining assailants. Nothing daunted, she swings her dominant hand down to her thigh on that side. It unfolds and places a pistol in her grip, which she brings up and uses to end the engagement.
	<br><br>
	After reloading her pistol from the ammunition compartment in her other thigh, she strides mechanically from body to body, a few of which are still moving. Stopping by each one, she places her palm against the base of each head with obscene care before extending the blade in her forearm through it. This done, she scans for further threats. There are none, and due to her terrifying display there is @@.green;an increase in confidence in the security of $arcologies[0].name@@ and @@.green;public applause for your skill in training her.@@ There is some @@.red;minor damage@@ to repair, but no lasting harm.

	You are prepared for this exigency. Your handsome clothing conceals a small but very powerful pistol. This fact comes slowly back to you as your ears and mind shake off the blast effects. There is something important about this fact, but you are having trouble thinking of it. Eventually, you remember, and groggily draw and level the weapon. Its rocket-assisted slugs detonate on contact, assisting your impaired marksmanship by causing fatal damage regardless of shot placement. You are alive, and you are not permanently damaged, which is more than can be said for your assailants, who have with the assistance of your weapon redecorated this area of the club in red tones. There is some @@.red;minor property damage@@ to repair, but no lasting harm.

<<elseif $mercenaries > 0>>
	As you collect your senses, you are dimly aware of a massive form rushing to stand over you. In its hands is a chunky object that emits three long tongues of flame and makes three barking sounds that break through the ringing in your ears. You manage to get yourself together enough to understand the mercenary as he slings his shotgun and kneels to check you over. His experienced hands disclose no injury, and he says, "You'll be OK, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>. Come on, up and at 'em. Let's get you checked out." There is some @@.red;minor property damage@@ to repair, but no lasting harm.

Hours later, you receive another message from the Daughters of Liberty. This one is even briefer than the first. "Next time, '<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>>,'" it reads.
