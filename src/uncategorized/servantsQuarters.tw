<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
	are spartan, yet functional. At one end of the long dormitory there is an alcove with a shrine to the Roman goddess of domesticity.
<<case "Egyptian Revivalist">>
	are utilitarian, yet warm and well-kept. At one end of the long dormitory there is an alcove with a shrine to the Egyptian goddess of servility.

	are spartan and functional. Fresh mats are laid across the floor every day, and the simple beds of blankets and wooden blocks are neatly stowed against the walls before sunrise.
<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>

<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
	are spartan, yet functional. At one end of the long dormitory there is an alcove with a shrine hosting a bronze statue of a watchful dragon.
<<case "Chattel Religionist">>
	are spartan, yet functional. Servants here are expected to be clean and hardworking, and there is a penitents cell ready for them if they are not.
<<case "Degradationist">>
	are severe and utilitarian. Servants sleep uncomfortably here, knowing that even on their meager bedrolls, they are fair game for abuse.
<<case "Repopulation Focus">>

<<case "Supremacist">>

<<case "Subjugationist">>

<<if $servantsQuartersSlaves > 2>>
	$servantsQuartersNameCaps are busy with hurrying slaves. One shift of girls is eating, cleaning the quarters, and bathing. The second is sleeping, and the third is out in the penthouse cleaning and serving.
<<elseif $servantsQuartersSlaves > 0>>
	A few slaves are working out of servants' quarters. They must split their scant time between looking after their own needs and the superior needs of everyone else.
