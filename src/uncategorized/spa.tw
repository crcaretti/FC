$spaNameCaps
<<switch $spaDecoration>>
<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
	is built as a Roman bath. The flooring is pleasantly warm due to a modernized version of hypocaust heating, and is covered in mosaic depicting slaves enjoying sex.
<<case "Egyptian Revivalist">>
	is decorated like an Egyptian water garden. All but the hottest pools include aquatic plants around their edges, and the atmosphere is heavy with perfume.
<<case "Edo Revivalist">>
	is decorated like a traditional onsen. The stone-lined pools are surrounded by meticulously kept gardens, and there are proper provisions for bathing in the old Japanese style.
<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>
	looks like a dream of an Arabian palace garden. Every surface is richly tiled in vibrant colors, and the beguiling scents of perfumes from the Levant hang in the air.
<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
	is gloomy and hot, filled with an oppressive steam that immediately dulls the senses. Though relaxation is possible and indeed easy here, it is a stultifying relaxation whose humid warmth seems to suppress independence.
<<case "Chattel Religionist">>
	is dedicated to the purification of the body and the spirit. The pools are arranged for the completion of self-purification procedures which include ritual masturbation.
<<case "Degradationist">>

<<case "Eugenics">>
	is comfortable, albeit split in half. One side for the lower classes' slaves, and the other for the elite and their pets.

<<if $spaSlaves > 3>>
	It's busy in here. Slaves are relaxing in the warm water, splashing around or just floating. Here and there some of the more sex-starved are in the early stages of intercourse, but most prefer to take time off from it all.
<<elseif $spaSlaves > 0>>
	It's sparsely populated; though the few slaves here have little company they like having the water to themselves.
<<elseif $Attendant != 0>>
	$Attendant.slaveName is alone here, and has nothing to do but keep the place (and her own soft, wet body) spotlessly clean.
<<else>>
	It's empty and quiet. [[Decommission the Spa|Main][$spa = 0, $spaDecoration = "standard", $spaUpgrade = 0, $spaFix = 0]]

<<elseif $spaFix == 1>>
	$Attendant.slaveName is focusing on the health and wellness of the slaves under her care, as well as trying to bring mindbroken slaves back, while ignoring any mental hangups a slave may have.
	[[Order her to not fix flaws|Spa][$spaFix = 2]] |
	[[Let her tend as she sees fit|Spa][$spaFix = 0]]
<<else>>
	$Attendant.slaveName is not following any special orders and is tending to your slaves as she sees fit.
