:: RE AWOL [nobr]

<<set $nextButton = "Continue", $nextLink = "RIE Eligibility Check", $returnTo = "RIE Eligibility Check">>

Human soldiers are superior to drones in a number of ways - they have the capability for suspicion, the ability to understand human interactions, and are impervious to the ever-present threat of cyber-warfare. That said, a crucial failing of any sentient warrior is their agency.

<br><br>

On this particular evening, you find your work interrupted by an urgent alert from $assistantName.
<<if $assistant > 0>>
	"<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Master<<else>>Mistress<</if>>, one of the $mercenariesTitle has gone AWOL." She pauses before continuing. "She's taken a number of weapons with her."
<<else>>
	It informs you that one of the $mercenariesTitle has disappeared, seemingly taking with her a small stash of weapons.
<</if>>

<br><br>

Your window of opportunity to act is closing. If you have plans for punishing this dereliction from your authority, they must be set in motion now.

			Despite the trouble she has caused you, the culmination of this mercenary's wanton flight from the rest of the $mercenariesTitle is decidedly an anti-climax. The last you hear of the matter is chorus of grim grunts and nods as your mercenaries file back into the arcology. The matter is done.
		<<else>>
			Your mercenaries return to tell you that they could not find the mutineer. It could be that she managed to escape beyond their reach or that one among your 'loyal' retainers allowed her to flee your judgement, but alas there is little that can be done to remedy the issue now. Still, aside from a slight grumbling within the arcology, few fault you for allowing the $mercenariesTitle to recapture one of their own - even if they failed to do so.
