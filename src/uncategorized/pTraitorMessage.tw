The month after freeing $traitor.slaveName, you receive another message from the Daughters of Liberty. This one contains a video. It shows $traitor.slaveName sitting quietly at a table, wearing comfortable clothes and eating a nice meal. She looks a little bewildered, but there's an obvious happiness to her, it's impossible to deny. She seems unaware she's being recorded.

A voice cuts in, calm but filled with unmistakable rage: "I hope you don't think this fixes everything, scum. We're still coming for you, and for all your slaveowning friends. All you've bought with this is the chance to maybe come out alive at the end. We'll be in touch."
