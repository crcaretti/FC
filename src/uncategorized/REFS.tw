<<case "paternalist encounter">>

As a result of $arcologies[0].name's adoption of paternalism there has been a remarkable effect on relationships between slaves and owners, with the flourishing of mutual respect between the two forming the basis for social life in the arcology. However, not all citizens are so keen as to internalize the tenants of paternalism, whether out of prejudice, old habits or adherence to a more brutal style of slaveholding.
<br><br>
On one particular outing, you come across an elderly male citizen giving his young slave quite a thrashing in the street outside of a prominent apartment complex. From the skinned state of the poor girl's knees and the cruel spiked collar about her neck, it is clear that her owner has been dragging her about the arcology as if she were a dog. To say nothing of this degrading treatment, beating of a slave in public is a fineable offense.

<<case "degradationist encounter">>

As a result of $arcologies[0].name's adoption of degradationism there has been a remarkable effect on the social status of slaves, with the continued reduction of slave rights taking center stage. However, not all citizens are so keen as to internalize the tenants of degredationism, whether out of misplaced compassion, old habits or adherence to the Old World style of relationships.
<br><br>
On one particular outing, you come across an elderly male citizen holding the hand of his young slave, seemingly on a date at one of the arcology's prominent promenades. From the ring on the girl's finger and the modest neckline on her clothing, it is clear that her owner is treating her as if she is his wife. His obscene treatment of his slave has already drawn a large crowd of shocked onlookers.

<<case "physical idealist encounter">>

The notion of the physical ideal has taken $arcologies[0].name by storm and a number of enterprising citizens have been quick to respond by providing new services and businesses in response. One such innovation is the open air gym, a now common sight along $arcologies[0].name's many streets. Many citizens utilize such facilities to squeeze in an extra work-out on their daily commute, or in lieu of personal fitness facilities in their own homes.
<br><br>
While navigating your arcology on an outing, you find yourself coming across one of the arcology's finest open-air gyms, clearly marketed towards the wealthy citizen on the move. As impressive as the gold plated fitness equipment is, in amongst the power racks, dip bars and bench press stations is perhaps one of the most spectacular athletic specimens in the entire arcology. This female citizen has clearly embraced everything that $arcologies[0].name's physical idealism represents, molding herself into a rippling blend of broad shoulders, powerful muscles and a ripped stomach that would shame even the most well-built old world athlete.

<<case "pastoralist encounter">>

Pastoralism has taken $arcologies[0].name by storm and a number of enterprising citizens have been quick to respond by providing new services and businesses in response. One such innovation is a number of experimental new restaurants that incorporate human milk into their recipes, much to the delight of the citizenry. Such establishments have become a fashionable part of $arcologies[0].name's taste palate and new takes on the simple premise are common.
<br><br>
While navigating your arcology on an outing, you find yourself coming across one of the arcology's newest restaurants, a milkshake parlor that prides itself on deriving all of its dairy from human sources.

<<case "transformation fetishism encounter">>

As a result of $arcologies[0].name's adoption of transformation fetishism, a number of plastic surgery clinics, cosmetic surgeries and other transformative businesses have begun to crop up around the arcology's various promenades and shopping districts. The citizens of $arcologies[0].name have taken to the idea of altering their bodies with a gusto - though not all are so quick to adopt the trend just because it's in vogue.
<br><br>
On one particular outing, you come across a female citizen outside a surgery clinic staring pensively up at a poster advertising the variety of cosmetic procedures on offer in the institution. The citizen's expression is wistful, if somewhat grave, and at odds with the display above her lit up with silicone breasts, plump bee-stung lips and fake asses. From her unaltered appearance and simple garments, it is likely that she is not one of the arcology's wealthier denizens and thus is unable to shape her body to her heart's desire.

<<case "body purism encounter">>

As a result of $arcologies[0].name's adoption of body purism, a number of restorative spas, implant removal clinics and other cleansing businesses have begun to crop up around the arcology's various promenades and shopping districts. The citizens of $arcologies[0].name have taken to the idea of treating their bodies with sanctity - though not all are so quick to adopt the trend just because it's in vogue.
<br><br>
On one particular outing, you come across a female citizen outside a famous health spa staring pensively up at a poster advertising the variety of purification procedures on offer in the institution. The citizen's expression is wistful, if somewhat grave, and at odds with the display above her lit up with pure unadulterated bodies, expensive health treatments and a plethora of natural cosmetic procedures. The citizen's clothes are ragged and sheer, revealing a number of implant scars around her bust and rear, likely from a costly attempt to render herself fashionable by having her prior implants removed. With such visible scarring, it is unlikely that she is one of the arcology's wealthier denizens, having paid the price to return her body to its natural, unimplanted state.

<<case "youth preferentialist encounter">>

Your excursions out of your penthouse and into the arcology as a whole often put you in close proximity with citizens from all levels of the social strata. After all, they themselves have their own lives to live within the walls of $arcologies[0].name.
<br><br>
On this particular outing you happen to cross paths with a nubile young woman, accompanied by her father. From her plain clothes and rudimentary makeup, it is readily apparent that she is not one of the arcology's well-to-do inhabitants. She recognizes you quickly and dips her head in deference to your high status, <<if ($PC.visualAge >= 50)>>her cheeks flushed in embarrassment and delight at an aged arcology owner's interest in a young girl like her.<<else>>her expression awestruck by the presence of an arcology owner before her.<</if>>

<<case "maturity preferentialist encounter">>

Your excursions out of your penthouse and into the arcology as a whole often put you in close proximity with citizens from all levels of the social strata. After all, they themselves have their own lives to live within the walls of $arcologies[0].name.
<br><br>
On this particular outing you happen to cross paths with a comely female citizen and her two adult sons. From her plain clothes and conspicuous lack of makeup, it is readily apparent that she is not one of the arcology's well-to-do inhabitants. She recognizes you quickly and dips her head in deference to your high status, <<if ($PC.visualAge < 35)>>her cheeks flushed in embarrassment and confusion at a young arcology owner's interest in an old lady like her.<<else>>her expression awestruck by the presence of an arcology owner before her.<</if>>

When you part ways, the older woman is clearly smitten with you - so it's no wonder that by the next day the story of your encounter has @@.green;spread across $arcologies[0].name like wildfire@@.

	It only takes a moment for $assistantName to uncover the citizen's financial records and the copious debt therein, and only another moment for you to browbeat the terrified older women into sleeping with you under threat of purchasing all her debt and summarily enslaving her. Her sons, frightened into obedience by the possibility of losing their dear mother, take their cue to make themselves scarce during the encounter.
	<br><br>
	Once you both retire to your private suite, you peel the mature citizen's clothes off as easily as one might shed a gift of its wrapping. In the nude her body is tastefully plush, with wide hips, firm motherly breasts, and a delicate blush across her shamefaced, plump cheeks. Despite the circumstances of your sexual conquest of her, she seems to enjoy the fuck well enough by the sounds of her frenzied moans - citizens like her often do since sexual submission to a slave would be a crippling scandal to a prominent citizen, let alone one of her diminished social stature.

			After she regains her bearings from your sexual encounter, the older woman slips on her simple clothes and attempts to slink away from your private suite unobtrusively. She makes it out the door before being confronted by a glowing array of wallscreen monitors, each displaying a visual representation of your purchase of her considerable debt and subsequent enslavement of her on the basis of that debt. Tears begin to stream down her weathered cheeks as she sinks to her knees, her hopes of making it through the breadth of her long life without enslavement now dashed.
