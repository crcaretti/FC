One of your mercenaries requests an interview. He's a worn, grey-haired tank of a man, made bulkier still by heavy ceramic plate armor and lots of ammunition and gear. The murderous submachine gun favored for city fighting looks like a toy in his hands. But as he sits at your invitation and accepts a

"<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, I'll say this straight. I'd like to buy one of your slaves. I've been seeing <<EventNameLink $activeSlave>> a lot, and she makes the years sit a little lighter on me. I've scraped together what I can, and I can pay <<print cashFormat($slaveCost)>>." It's a decent price, probably a little less than you could get at auction. It's a huge sum for a mercenary; it's probably his entire savings. You ask what he would do with her. "Well," he says, actually blushing, "I'd free her. And marry her, if she'd have me."

	$activeSlave.slaveName obeys your orders not to see the old mercenary. Though neither he or $activeSlave.slaveName says a word about it, his squadmates are not so closemouthed.

	The mercenary cannot believe his ears. After you repeat yourself twice, he leaves to collect your gift, thanking you clumsily.

You smile to yourself; when they get there they'll find flowers and a paid reservation at the arcology's best restaurant. Soon the story is being told in bars and brothels across the Free City, with you naturally playing @@.green;a starring role.@@ Some days later, you hear a dramatization is being filmed, with an aging action star playing the mercenary, a rising starlet playing $activeSlave.slaveName, and a noted character actor playing you.
