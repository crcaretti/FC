One of your mercenaries requests an interview. He's a worn, grey-haired tank of a man, made bulkier still by heavy ceramic plate armor and lots of ammunition and gear. The murderous submachine gun favored for city fighting looks like a toy in his hands. But as he sits at your invitation and accepts a <<if $PC.refreshmentType == 0>>$PC.refreshmentType<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 1>>glass of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 2>>a plate of $PC.refreshment<<elseif $PC.refreshmentType == 3>>line of $PC.refreshment<<else>>syringe  of $PC.refreshment<</if>> proffered by an attentive slave girl, he seems almost bashful.

"<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, I'll say this straight. I'd like to buy one of your slaves. I've been seeing <span id="name"><<print "[[$activeSlave.slaveName|Long Slave Description][$nextLink = passage(), $eventDescription = 1]]">></span> a lot, and she makes the years sit a little lighter on me. I've scraped together what I can, and I can pay Â¤$slaveCost." It's a decent price, probably a little less than you could get at auction. It's a huge sum for a mercenary; it's probably his entire savings. You ask what he would do with her. "Well," he says, actually blushing, "I'd free her. And marry her, if she'd have me."

	$activeSlave.slaveName obeys your orders not to see the old mercenary. Though neither he or $activeSlave.slaveName says a word about it, his squadmates are not so closemouthed.

	"Ah well," he says, "didn't think you would, but I had to ask. If you'd be so kind as to keep her assigned so's I can see her, I would be grateful. That was a fine victory, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>; come down to the bar and join the boys and I. We'll buy you a drink. Devil knows, thanks to you we can afford to."

	The mercenary leaves to collect his purchase.

	The mercenary cannot believe his ears. After you repeat yourself twice, he leaves to collect your gift, thanking you clumsily. On the video feeds, you see that $activeSlave.slaveName can hardly believe what's happened. <<if $activeSlave.amp != 1>>She hugs him, sobbing into his shoulder.

You smile to yourself; when they get there they'll find flowers and a paid reservation at the arcology's best restaurant. Soon the story is being told in bars and brothels across the Free City, with you naturally playing @@.green;a starring role.@@ Some days later, you hear a dramatization is being filmed, with an aging action star playing the mercenary, a rising starlet playing $activeSlave.slaveName, and a noted character actor playing you.
