One of your mercenaries requests an interview. He's a worn, grey-haired tank of a man, made bulkier still by heavy ceramic plate armor and lots of ammunition and gear. The murderous submachine gun favored for city fighting looks like a toy in his hands. But as he sits at your invitation and accepts a

I've scraped together what I can, and I can pay <<print cashFormat($slaveCost)>>." It's a decent price, probably a little less than you could get at auction. It's a huge sum for a mercenary; it's probably his entire savings. You ask what he would do with her. "Well," he says, actually blushing, "I'd free her. And marry her, if she'd have me."

		$activeSlave.slaveName obeys your orders not to see the old mercenary. Though neither he or $activeSlave.slaveName says a word about it, his squadmates are not so closemouthed. Soon the tragic story of The Mercenary and the Slave Girl is being told in bars and brothels across the Free City, with you naturally playing @@.red;the role of the villain.@@
