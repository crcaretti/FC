	The leader of your $mercenariesTitle has contacted you from the world outside your arcology. It seems that your $mercenariesTitle have enjoyed a profitable series of raids in their time outside the arcology and have decided to push their luck by plundering one last location on their way back to the arcology. As their nominal leader, they ask your opinion of a small number of potential targets. Given the distance from the arcology and the time sensitivity of conducting such a mission, you have little to base your decision on besides a brief description.

Worthy of consideration is that although the $mercenariesTitle will enslave the lion's share of enslaved prisoners for the corporation, they will present you the finest slave captured as a gesture of respect for your high position.

	is the barracks of a local garrison in an Old World town.

Their sergeant is the nominal leader of the group, though she holds the position due to familial connections rather than any real military seniority.
