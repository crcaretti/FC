The Free Cities fashion scene extends to slave bodies, of course; stopping at mere clothes and behaviors is an old world conceit. This week, <span id="name"><<print "[[$activeSlave.slaveName|Long Slave Description][$nextLink = passage(), $eventDescription = 1]]">></span> is in vogue. Such a crowd of gawkers and hangers-on follows her around the club that the fine citizens who have a chance at an hour of her time must shoulder their way through the throng.

This is a rare opportunity. Such popularity and fame is here today, and gone tomorrow. It might be possible, with a serious investment of funds in publicity, to really fix her in the public mind as a courtesan of note. There's no guarantee of success, but if you are successful, her value will increase a great deal.
