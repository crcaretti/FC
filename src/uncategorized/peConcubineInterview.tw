You receive an official communication from a popular talk show hosted in one of the old world's still-thriving first world countries. Your fame has become known even in the old world, and they'd like to interview <<EventNameLink $activeSlave>> about you. They frankly warn you that you'll have no right to review the interview and no ability to control what she says, and that they'll be asking about anything the interviewer thinks is juicy. This could be great for your reputation, but it could be hazardous, too.

	The show is broadcast live; you head out onto a balcony to watch it on a big screen. It's been impossible to hide, and many of your citizens have taken a proprietary attitude towards your fame: they see your success as their success, too, and want to see $activeSlave.slaveName do well. The show introduction plays, introducing the host, a swishy, rail-thin gentleman with impeccable sartorial style and a close-cropped salt-and-pepper beard. He reviews who you are, giving equal time to your accomplishments and the inevitable criticisms from old world antislavery activists, and then calls $activeSlave.slaveName out.

		The host, taken off guard, laughs in surprise and says he envies you that. He asks a follow up question that hints at her sexual preferences without coming straight out and asking how she likes it.
		<<if $activeSlave.intelligenceImplant + $activeSlave.entertainSkill >= 100>>
