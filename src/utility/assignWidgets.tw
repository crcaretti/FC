	Call as <<assignJob slaveObject $returnTo | _currentRule.facilityRemove | "serve in the master suite"
	$args[0] slave object. *MUST be present*
	$args[1] Job to assign slave to. Will accept the $returnTo vars and the _currentRule.assignFacility vars and the actual job assignments "serve in the master suite" etc.

	This is basically a Widget version of assign but will work anywhere, and saves to the slaves[..] array, and changes your $args[0] var sent.

	Call as <<removeJob slaveObject $returnTo | _currentRule.facilityRemove | "serve in the master suite">>
	$args[0] slave object. *MUST be present*
	$args[1] Job to remove slave from. Will accept the $returnTo vars and the _currentRule.assignFacility vars and the actual job assignments "serve in the master suite" etc.

	This is basically a Widget version of Retrieve but will work anywhere. It changes the assignment and saves to the slaves[..] array, and changes your $args[0] var sent.
	Retrieve overrides the 'rest' in most cases.
