The confined spaces of the arcology and the number of vital yet delicate systems within its walls do not allow a lot of tactical flexibility. This will be a long and strenous fight, stree after street, barricade after barricade.
In order to preserve the structural integrity of the building and the lives of our civilians, we will have to limit our firepower.

We can dedicate some of our forces to the protection of the vital parts of the arcology, doing so will prevent the failure of said systems, but will also take away strength from our assault.
