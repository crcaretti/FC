This sector of the arcology has been dedicated to weapons manufacturing. These factories supply

<<if $mercenaries >0>> your mercenaries and<</if>>
many small old world nations as the advanced technology that free cities have available is hard to come by otherwise.

<<if $weapProductivity == 1>>
	Production is completely manned by human workers. The complex has close to zero automation.
<<elseif $weapProductivity == 2>>
	Production is mostly handled by human workers. A few of the most tiresome tasks are handled by robots.
<<elseif $weapProductivity == 3>>
	A good part of production is handled by robots with humans handling the most complex tasks.
<<elseif $weapProductivity == 4>>
	Almost all production is handled by robots, with humans acting as support for the machines.
<<else>>
	All production here is handled by robots. The few humans working in the complex occupy themselves exclusively with management and quality assurance.

<<if $weapLab == 1>>
	There's a very Spartan lab attached to the complex that occupies itself mainly with weapons testing and small adjustments to the manufacturing process.
<<elseif $weapLab == 2>>
	There's a lab attached to the complex. It mainly test weapons effectiveness and manufacturing efficiency, but has enough equipment and personnel to develop new technology.
<<else>>
	There's a large lab attached to the complex. The complement of equipment and personnel makes it a great beacon of military science in an otherwise ignorant world.
