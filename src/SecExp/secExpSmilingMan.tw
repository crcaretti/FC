	<br>
	During your morning routine you stumble upon a peculiar report: it's been several weeks now that your arcology has been victim of a series of cyber-crimes conducted by a mysterious figure.
	The egocentric criminal took great pride in its acts, to the point of signing his acts with his or her peculiar symbol: a stylized smiling face. Your arcology was not the only one under assault by the
	machinations of what the media would quickly nicknamed //the smiling man//.
	<br>Despite the sheer damage this criminal was doing, you cannot help but admire the skill with which every misdeed is carried: the worst white collar crimes of the century carried out with such elegance
	they almost seemed the product of natural laws rather than masterful manipulation of the digital market.
	While you sift through the pages of the report, $assistantName remains strangely quiet. "I'm worried <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>sir<<else>>ma'am<</if>>, this individual seems to be able to penetrate whatever system gathers his attention. I... feel vulnerable" she said "It's not something I'm used to."
	<br>Fortunately you have not been hit directly by this criminal, not yet at least. Still the repercussions of numerous bankruptcies take their toll on your arcology, whose @@.red;prosperity suffers@@.

	You just reached your penthouse, when your faithful assistant appears in front of you, evidently excited. 
	"<<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>Sir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, I have just received news of a new attack by the Smiling Man. It appears just a few hours ago he infiltrated another arcology and caused a catastrophic failure of its power plant.
	Between old debts and the loss of value for his shares, the owner went bankrupt in minutes. It seems the Smiling Man managed to keep a small auxiliary generator functioning enough to project a giant holographic picture of his symbol on the arcology's walls.
	You can say whatever you want about him, but he has style... Anyway this opens up a great opportunity to gain control of the structure for ourselves."
	It is indeed a great opportunity, one you cannot resist. You quickly organize the affair and in a few minutes a message reaches your assistant.
	<br>"Should I open it?" asks. You silently nod.
	<br>Suddenly the room flashes red, while your assistant fades for half a second. When it reappears her face was replaced by a stylized smiling face.
	<br>"Hello, my dear $PC.name. Can I call you by name, right? I've been keeping an eye on you for so long now, it feels like we're friends! I am terribly sorry for my unannounced visit, but I wanted to meet face to face... well face to hologram." said while letting out a very childlike giggle.
	"You see I'm sure you're aware of my recent activities around this rock of ours and... well to put it simply it's your turn to contribute to my great project! Oh you'll love it when you see it, I'm sure! By the way, thanks for the offer, it's so nice to see people contribute to a worthy cause so generously! Well I've taken enough of your time, see you soon!"
	<br>The lights flickered once more and an instant later your assistant returned to her usual self.
	<br>"I... I... I couldn't stop him! I'm sorry <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>sir<<else>>ma'am<</if>>."
	<br>Without wasting time you rush the console and check your finances. It's as you feared, @@.red;you have been robbed@@.

	When $assistantName wakes you up violently, her worried expression can mean only one thing: the smiling man was back. "Today at midnight a new site popped up in the web: it's a very simple site, no visuals, no text, no data, only a countdown ticking away. It will reach zero this evening." said.
	This is troubling yet exciting news. The smiling man never failed to cause damage, but his ego got the best of him this time: having time to prepare before its attack will give you a chance to find him. For the rest of the day you do your best to plan, prepare and focus.
	<br>
	<br>Evening came faster than you anticipated, by now your security team was already at full alert, waiting for any signal on the horizon. The die was cast.
	<br>Suddenly all the computers in the room start acting weirdly, then it happened. On all screens in all the arcology the smiling man icon appeared, then every speaker started broadcasting the same voice, one that you already heard once before:
	<br>"Hello citizens of Earth! I am here in this special day to relay to you a very important message: we find ourselves in very peculiar times, times of strife and suffering! But also of change and regeneration! Indeed I say humanity is regenerating itself, turning into a new being for which the
	ideals of the old world no longer hold meaning. A new blank page from which humanity can start to prosper again.
	<br>Alas my friends not all is good, as in this rebirth a great injustice is being perpetrated. If we truly want to ascend to this new form of humanity the old must give space to the new. If we must cleanse our mind of old ideas, our world must cleanse itself of them as well.
	It's to fix this injustice that I worked so hard all this time! To cleanse the world of the old, we must get rid of our precious, precious data. At the end of this message every digital device will see its memory erased, every archive cleaned, every drive deleted.
	<br>It will be a true rebirth! A true new beginning! No longer will the chains of the past keep humanity anchored!"
	<br>The voice stopped for a second.
	<br>"Have a good day." simply concluded, then it happened.
	<br>In little more than seconds all the data collected in the years vanished. It is a disaster.

	The day has come to finally put an end to this story. Your men are ready to go, waiting only your signal. You quickly don your protective gear and proceed down the busy streets of your arcology.
	You carefully planned the day so that nothing could exit the arcology without being scanned at least three times and poked twice. The smiling man has no escape.
	<br>After a short walk you are in front of the criminal's lair, an rundown old apartment in a scarcely populated part of the arcology. You give the order to breach and your men rush inside without problems.
	After a couple of seconds pass without a single noise coming out of the apartment, you start to worry, when you hear the captain calling you inside.
	<br>"So it was you to find me first.

	"As you can see I have no intention of escaping. I knew my life was over the second my plan would start. I accepted my end a long time ago, so feel free to do your worst; my life has already ended in triumph."
	<br>You evaluate the situation: the burning desire of vengeance for all the damage that little twerp caused is hard to ignore, but it's equally so the admiration for her skill and determination. Indeed she would be a great addition to your court, as free individual or not.
