<strong>The Smiling Man</strong>
<br>

<<if $laughingManProgress == 0>>
	<br>During your morning routine you stumble upon a peculiar report: it's been several weeks now that your arcology has been victim of a series of cyber-crimes conducted by a mysterious figure.
	The egocentric criminal took great pride in its acts, to the point of signing his acts with his or her peculiar symbol: a stylized smiling face. Your arcology was not the only one under assault by the
	machinations of what the media would quickly nickname //the smiling man//.
	<br>Despite the sheer damage this criminal was doing, you cannot help but admire the skill with which every misdeed is carried: the worst white collar crimes of the century carried out with such elegancy
	they almost seemed the product of natural laws rather than masterful manipulations of the digital markets.
	Whiel you sift through the pages of the report, $assistantName remained strangely quiet. "I'm worried, <<if def $PC.customTitle>>$PC.customTitle<<elseif $PC.title != 0>>sir<<else>>ma'am<</if>>, this individual seems to be able to penetrate whatever system gathers his attention. I... feel vulnerable" she said "It's not something I'm used to."
	<br>Fortunately you have not been hit directly by this criminal, not yet at least. Still the repercussions of numerous bankruptcies take their toll on your arcology, whose @@.red;prosperty suffers@@.
