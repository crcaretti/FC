			Free City expeditions are usually composed of mercenaries hired to take down sensible supplies or infrastructure in order to damage the enemies of their contractor.

			Freedom Fighters are groups of individuals fighting to rid the planet of "evils" such as the free cities and their way of life. Lacking the strenght to assault one directly they fight guerrilla style slowly starving to death their enemies.

			Old world expeditions are usually sent to secure resources and trade routs for their nation or, more often, to provide their citizens with a boogey man to be scared of.

		Your assistant interrupted your rest to bring the grim news. You quickly rush to your console, where you can see one of the convoys supplying your arcology has been attacked and looted. It seems a group of desperate looking bandits decided it was a good idea to steal from you.
		Due to their great wealth, free cities inevitably become tasty morsels for anyone able to field armed men. Considering the particular needs of arcologies their supply lines tend to be delicate lifelines, often preyed upon by those who stand to gain from the free city downfall.
