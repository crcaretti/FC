<strong>Attack Imminent</strong>
<hr>
<<if $hasFoughtOnce == 1>>
	The ominous message dominates the screens of your office, <<print $assistantName>> quickly gathers all information available to prepare for battle.
	<<if $attackType == "raiders">>
		<<if $recon >= 1>>
			A disorganized horde of raiders is coming to your city. To such jackals your arcology surely looks like an appetizing morsel.
			Fortunately you knew of their coming, thanks to your recon systems.
		<<else>>
			Some of your citizens saw the disorganized horde of raiders coming towards the city and quickly reported it. To such jackals your arcology surely looks like an appetizing morsel.
		<</if>>
		<br>
		Raiders are roaming gangs of bandits, preying on the vulnerable supply lines of free cities and old world nations. They are rarely equipped with decent armaments and even more rarely have any formal military training, but they make up for that with high mobility and numbers.
	<<elseif $attackType == "free city">>
		<<if $recon >= 1>>
			A menacing column of consumed mercenaries and slavers is coming to your city. Another free city is ready to use their best tools to hit a dangerous competitor where it hurts.
			Fortunately you knew of their coming, thanks to your recon systems.
		<<else>>
			Some of your citizens saw the menacing column of consumed mercenaries and slavers and rushed to your office to bring the grim news. Another free city is ready to use their best tools to bring down a dangerous competitor.
		<</if>>
		<br>
		Free City expeditions are usually composed of mercenaries hired to take down sensible supplies or infrastructure in order to damage the enemies of their contractor. They have on average good equipment and training, together with decent mobility, making them a formidable force. Their biggest weakness however is their low numbers.
	<<elseif $attackType == "freedom fighters">>
		<<if $recon >= 1>>
			A dangerous looking army of guerrillas is gathering just outside the arcology. Fanatics and idealists armed with dead men's words and hope, set on erasing your fledgling empire. 
			Fortunately you knew of their coming, thanks to your recon systems.
		<<else>>
			Some of your citizens saw the dangerous looking army of guerrillas is gathering just outside the arcology. Fanatics and idealists armed with dead men's words and hope, set on erasing your fledgling empire.
		<</if>>
		<br>
		Freedom Fighters are groups of individuals fighting to rid the planet of "evils" such as the free cities and their way of life. Lacking the strenght to assault one directly they fight guerrilla style slowly starving to death their enemies. They are rarely well equipped, but with good training and mobility they are not a threat that can be taken lightly.
	<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
		<<if $recon >= 1>>
			A diciplined yet dusty, scruffy old world army is approaching the confines of your arcology. There's nothing better than a good war to unite the electorate and your arcology is just the perfect target. 
			Fortunately you knew of their coming, thanks to your recon systems.
		<<else>>
			Some of your citizens saw the diciplined yet dusty, scruffy old world army is approaching the confines of your arcology. There's nothing better than a good war to unite the electorate and your arcology is just the perfect target. 
		<</if>>
		<br>
		Old world expeditions are usually sent to secure resources and trade routs for their nation or, more often, to provide their citizens with a boogey man to be scared of. They are usually decently equipped and trained, which together with their generous numbers make them a tough nut to crack. They however often lack in mobility.
	<</if>>
<<else>>
	Your assistant interrupted your rest to bring the grim news. You quickly rush to your console, where you can see one of the convoys supplying your arcology has been attacked and looted. It seems a group of desperate looking bandits decided it was a good idea to steal from you.
	Due to their great wealth, free cities inevitably become tasty morsels for anyone able to field armed men. Considering the particular needs of arcologies their supply lines tend to be delicate lifelines, often preyed upon by those who stand to gain from the free city downfall.
	<br>You quickly summon your security drones to deal with the threat.
<</if>>

<br><br>

It seems your troops and your adversary will fight
<<if $battleTerrain == "rural">>
	in <strong>the rural land</strong> surrounding the free city.
<<elseif $battleTerrain == "hills">>
	on <strong>the hills</strong> around the free city.
<<elseif $battleTerrain == "coast">>
	along <strong>the coast</strong> just outside the free city.
<<elseif $battleTerrain == "outskirts">>
	right against <strong>the walls of the arcology.</strong>
<<elseif $battleTerrain == "mountains">>
	in <strong>the mountains</strong> overlooking the arcology.
<<elseif $battleTerrain == "wasteland">>
	in <strong>the wastelands</strong> outside the free city territory.
<</if>>
<<set _expectedEquip = 0>>
<<if $recon == 3>>
	Your recon capabilities are top notch. The information collected will be most likely correct or very close to be so:<<set _expectedEquip = $attackEquip + random(-1,1)>>
<<elseif $recon == 2>>
	Your recon capabilities are decent. The information collected will be mostly close to the truth:<<set _expectedEquip = $attackEquip + random(-1,2)>>
<<elseif $recon == 1>>
	Your recon capabilities are fairly low. The information collected will be quite inaccurate:<<set _expectedEquip = $attackEquip + random(-2,2)>>
<<else>>
	Your recon capabilities are almost non-existent. The information collected will be wild guesses at best:<<set _expectedEquip = $attackEquip + random(-2,3)>>
<</if>>
approximately <strong><<print Math.round($attackTroops * (1 + either(-1,1) * (random(3,4) - $recon) * 0.1))>> men</strong> are coming, they seems to be
<<if _expectedEquip <= 0>>
	<strong>poorly armed</strong>. old rusty small arms are the norm with just a few barely working civilian vehicles. 
<<elseif _expectedEquip == 1>>
	<strong>lightly armed</strong>. mostly small arms with some repurposed civilian vehicles and a scattered few machine guns. There's no sign of heavy vehicles, artillery or aircrafts.
<<elseif _expectedEquip == 2>>
	<strong>decently armed</strong>. good quality small arms, machine guns a few mortars. There seems to be some heavy military vehicles coming as well.
<<elseif _expectedEquip == 3>>
	<strong>well armed</strong>. high quality small arms, snipers, demolitions teams, heavy duty machine guns and mortars. Heavy military vehicles are numerous and a few artillery piecies are accompaning the detachment. 
<<elseif _expectedEquip == 4>>
	<strong>extremely well armed</strong>. excellent small arms and specialized teams with heavy duty infantry support weapons. Heavy presence of armored military vehicles, artillery pieces and even some attack helicopters.
