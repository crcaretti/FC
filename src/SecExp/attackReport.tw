		The hills offer protection to both your troops and your enemy's, making it harder for your men to accomplish guerrilla attacks effectively.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
		While not as defensible as mountains, hills offer numerous opportunities to funnel the enemy towards highly defensible choke points.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Interior Lines">>
		The limited mobility on hills hampers the capability of your troops to exploit the defender's greater mobility afforded by interior lines. 
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Pincer Manouver">>
		Limited mobility due to the hills is a double edged sword, affording your men a decent shot at incirclement.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Defense In Depth">>
		The limited mobility on hills hampers the capability of your troops to use elastic defense tactics.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Blitzkrieg">>
		The limited mobility on hills hampers the capability of your troops to organize lightning strikes.

		On the coast there's little space and protection to effectively employ guerrilla tactics.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
		Amphibious attacks are difficult in the best of situations, the defender has a very easy time funneling the enemy towards their key defensive positions.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Interior Lines">>
		While in an amphibious landing mobility is not the defender best weapon, exploiting interior lines still affords your troops some advantages. 
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Pincer Manouver">>
		Attempting to encircle a landing party is not the best course of action, but not the worst either.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Defense In Depth">>
		In an amphibious assault it's very easy for the enemy to overextend, making defense in depth tactics quite effective.

		Fighting just beneath the walls of the arcology does not allow for the dynamic redeployment of troops guerrilla tactics would require.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
		The imposing structure of the arcology itself provides plenty of opportunities to create fortified choke points where to shatter the enemy assault.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Interior Lines">>
		While the presence of the arcology near the battlefield is an advantage, it does limit manouverability, lowering overall effectiveness of interior lines tactics.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Pincer Manouver">>
		While the presence of the arcology near the battlefield is an advantage, it does limit manouverability, lowering the chances of making an effective encirclement.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Defense In Depth">>
		Having the arcology near the battlefield means there are limited available manouvers to your troops, who still needs to defend the structure, making defense in depth tactics not as effective.
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Blitzkrieg">>
		While an assault may save the arcology from getting involved at all, having the imposing structure so near does limit manouverability and so the impetus of the lightning strike.

		The high tech equipment free cities can afford to give their guns for hire means there's no defensive position strong enough to stop them, still the relatively low numbers means they will have to take a careful approach, slowing them down.

		Old world armies have both the manpower and the equipment to conquer any defensive position, making use of strong fortifications will onyl bring you this far against them.
