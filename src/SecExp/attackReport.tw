		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
			While not as defensible as mountains, hills offer numerous opportunities to funnel the enemy towards highly defensible choke points.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Interior Lines">>
			The limited mobility on hills hampers the capability of your troops to exploit the defender's greater mobility afforded by interior lines.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Pincer Maneuver">>
			Limited mobility due to the hills is a double edged sword, affording your men a decent shot at encirclement.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Defense In Depth">>
			The limited mobility on hills hampers the capability of your troops to use elastic defense tactics.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Blitzkrieg">>
			The limited mobility on hills hampers the capability of your troops to organize lightning strikes.

			On the coast there's little space and protection to effectively employ guerrilla tactics.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
			Amphibious attacks are difficult in the best of situations, the defender has a very easy time funneling the enemy towards their key defensive positions.

			Attempting to encircle a landing party is not the best course of action, but not the worst either.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Defense In Depth">>
			In an amphibious assault it's very easy for the enemy to overextend, making defense in depth tactics quite effective.

			Fighting just beneath the walls of the arcology does not allow for the dynamic redeployment of troops guerrilla tactics would require.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
			The imposing structure of the arcology itself provides plenty of opportunities to create fortified choke points where to shatter the enemy assault.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Interior Lines">>
			While the presence of the arcology near the battlefield is an advantage, it does limit maneuverability, lowering overall effectiveness of interior lines tactics.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Pincer Maneuver">>
			While the presence of the arcology near the battlefield is an advantage, it does limit maneuverability, lowering the chances of making an effective encirclement.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Defense In Depth">>
			Having the arcology near the battlefield means there are limited available maneuvers to your troops, who still needs to defend the structure, making defense in depth tactics not as effective.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Blitzkrieg">>
			While an assault may save the arcology from getting involved at all, having the imposing structure so near does limit maneuverability and so the impetus of the lightning strike.

		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
			The mountains offer plenty of opportunity to build strong defensive positions where to shatter the enemy's assault.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Interior Lines">>
			While the rough terrain complicates maneuvers, the defensive advantages offered by the mountains offsets its negative impact.
		<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Pincer Maneuver">>
			The rough terrain complicates maneuvers, your men have a really hard time pulling off an effective encirclement in this environment.

			While the wastelands are mostly open terrain, there are enough hiding spots to make guerrilla tactics work well enough.

			The wastelands are mostly open terrain, your men have a difficult time setting up effective fortified positions.

			The modern armies hired by free cities are decently mobile, which means quick hit and run attacks will be less successful, but their discipline and confidence still make them quite susceptible to this type of attack.
		<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
			While old world armies are tough nuts to crack, their predictability makes them the perfect target for hit and run and harassment tactics.

	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Choke Points">>
		<<if $attackType == "raiders">>
			Raiders lack heavy weaponry or armour, so making use of fortified positions is an excellent way to dissipate the otherwise powerful momentum of their assault.
		<<elseif $attackType == "free city">>
			The high tech equipment free cities can afford to give their guns for hire means there's no defensive position strong enough to stop them, still the relatively low numbers means they will have to take a careful approach, slowing them down.
		<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
			Old world armies have both the manpower and the equipment to conquer any defensive position, making use of strong fortifications will only bring you this far against them.
		<<elseif $attackType == "freedom fighters">>
			The lack of specialized weaponry means freedom fighters have a rather hard time overcoming tough defensive positions, unfortunately they have also a lot of experience in avoiding them.
		<</if>>
	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Interior Lines">>
		<<if $attackType == "raiders">>
			The highly mobile horde of raiders will not give much room for your troops to maneuver, lowering their tactical superiority.
		<<elseif $attackType == "free city">>
			While decently mobile, free cities forces are not in high enough numbers to risk maintaining prolonged contact, allowing your troops to quickly disengage and redeploy where it hurts.
		<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
			Old world armies are not famous for the mobility, which makes them highly susceptible to any tactic that exploits maneuverability and speed.
		<<elseif $attackType == "freedom fighters">>

			While their low discipline makes them prime candidates for an elastic defense type of strategy, their high numbers limit your troops maneuverability.
		<<elseif $attackType == "free city">>
			With their low numbers free cities mercenaries are quite susceptible to this type of tactic, despite their mobility.
		<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
			With their low mobility old world armies are very susceptible to this type of strategy.
		<<elseif $attackType == "freedom fighters">>
			Low mobility and not particularly high numbers mean freedom fighters can be defeated by employing elastic defense tactics.

	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Blitzkrieg">>
		<<if $attackType == "raiders">>
			With their low discipline and lack of heavy equipment, lightning strikes are very effective against raider hordes.
		<<elseif $attackType == "free city">>
			Having good equipment and discipline on their side, free cities expeditions are capable of responding to even strong lightning strikes.
		<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
			While disciplined, old world armies low mobility makes them highly susceptible to lightning strikes.
		<<elseif $attackType == "freedom fighters">>
			While not well equipped, freedom fighters have plenty of experience fighting small, mobile attacks, making them difficult to defeat with lightning strikes.

	<<elseif $chosenTactic == "Human Wave">>
		<<if $attackType == "raiders">>
			The hordes of raiders are much more experienced than your soldiers in executing mass assaults and they also have a lot more bodies to throw in the grinder.
		<<elseif $attackType == "free city">>
			The good equipment and mobility of free cities mercenaries cannot save them from an organized mass assault.
		<<elseif $attackType == "old world">>
			Unfortunately the discipline and good equipment of old world armies allow them to respond well against a mass assault.
		<<elseif $attackType == "freedom fighters">>
			The relative low numbers and not great equipment typical of freedom fighters make them susceptible to being overwhelmed by an organized mass assault.
