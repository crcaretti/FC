Mod to expand the security of the arcology.

	Major new stats:
		-security: represents the readiness of the arcology against external and internal threats.
			Used to evaluate the success of attacks and the eventual damage caused.
		-authority: represents the control over the arcology's population the player has.
			Used to evaluate likelyhood of citizens or slave rebellions as well as the likelyhood of citizens to join militias or foreign espionage ops.
	Minor new stats:
		-mercenary loyalty: represents the goodwill the player has accumulated with the hired mercenary squad/company/platoon.
			Used to evaluate likelyhood of mercenary revolt or treason.
			
	Security events will be:
		-citizens revolt
			Caused by: 	very high citizen to slave ratio (too few slaves!), low security and/or recent attacks (the owner is incapable of asssuring our safety!),
						introducing unpopular policies (we did not sign up for this!), introducing unpopular/new FSs (what mockery of society we live in!)
		-slave revolts
			Caused by:	very low citizens to slave ratio (The masters are few and we are many!), low security and/or recent attacks (the masters are weak!),
						introducing unpopular policies (our lives will get even worse!), introducing unpopular/new FSs (our lives will get even worse!)
		-mercenary revolt
			Caused by: 	failure to pay for their upkeep for some time (we will take what is ours whether you like or not!),
						bribery by other arcology/free city/old world nation (we are mercenary, loyal to who pays us more)
		-Neighbouring arcologies attack
			Caused by:	high prosperity in relationship with the other arcologies (the fat pigs are hoarding all the riches!),
						ideological conflict (self explanatory)
		-Free City assault
			Caused by: 	high prosperity and/or low security (they're a tasty morsel!)
		-Raiders
			Caused by:	N. of weeks passed, state of world economy (we need to survive somehow!)
		-Old World assault
			Caused by: 	extreme social engineering (decadent degenerates!), very high prosperity (That wealth is our by right!)
		-Freedom Fighters
			Caused by: 	very low citizens to slave ratio (we can free many slaves here!),introducing unpopular policies (those poor souls!),
						introducing unpopular/new FSs (this is not a future I want to see!)
						
	New Buildings:
		-Security Center (upgrade for penthouse)
			Function: provides ways to boost authority  as well as early warnings for incoming attacks. Some upgrades can lower prosperity.
		-Propaganda Hub	(upgrade for markets slot)
			Function: provides ways to boost authority and reputation, as well as improving arcologies/free cities/old world nations relationships
		-Docks/railroads/airports (depending on the arcology geographical position) (upgrade for manufactoring slot)
			Function: provides boosts to prosperity and allows for manipulation of slaves prices.
			However the better it is upgraded the faster it will erode security. Can be upgraded to boost authority.
	
	New functionality for existing buildings:
		-Barracks can train and equip citizens militias and slave soldiers.
		-club and brothel can be upgraded to provide a small boost to security or authority.
		-Similar to docks/Railroads/airports, the corporate market will slowly erode security, but can be upgraded to deny this.
