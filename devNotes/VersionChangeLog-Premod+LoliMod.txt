	-fixed some bugs
	Run backwards compatibility. No exceptions.
	I think everything is in place that needs to be in place. Very little beyond behind the scenes type code. If everything went right, there should be nothing really noticeable yet.
	The most obvious change will be the alterations to menopause. It is no longer hard set at 47, instead it drifts slightly year by year. This means that over a slave's lifetime, you will see a variance of when they go through menopause.

New Lolimod - not incorporated

10/06/16
	0.8.7.1
	
10/03/16
	0.8.6.7
	In this update, loli nicknames are back, retirement age can be set lower in policies, and you can now pursue up to 6 FS directions!
	
09/21/16
	
	2
	With the 2 bugfixes applied
	
	0.8.6.1
		
09/18/16
	0.8.5.3

	0.8.2.0
	
08/19/16
	0.8.1.4
	
08/16/16
	0.8.1.3
	- The "disable age penalties for jobs" submod now has a mechanical effect rather than just changing messages.
	- The long-standing change that allows slaves without balls but with artificial male hormone injections to experience erections has been added in some places where it was missing.  In the process a vanilla bug in "SA serve your other slaves" where the wrong slave's attributes were being checked was corrected.
	- Fixed the "flaws her mouth" silliness that somehow snuck back in from the base game.  (It should be "quirks her mouth" so it was probably the victim of Replace All.)
	- Incorporates a fix posted on halfchan for the "force her to rape herself" option for new slaves not appearing.
	- Fixed one place in the game where a slave could refer to young slave as a "teenager" although she might be preteen.
	
	0.8.1.3.1
	-Fix for a variable name in "ask her about her feelings."
	
08/09/16

07/27/16
	0.7.10.1
	-Redisigned buying other FS clothing, it is now found under a new subsection of Manage Arcology.
	-fixed bugs and typos
		
		- >>20506, >>20508 Okay, this bug should finally be fixed.  Also tweaked loli nicknames a bit.

	0.7.10.0
