(devoted)
, while not necessarily fun, is appreciated by your devoted slave nonetheless.


(not devoted)
Causes her consternation and humiliation.


(devoted)
She is thrilled at your modifications to her genitals, and is excited to explore those changes with you.


(not devoted)
She is enraged and frightened to see such changes to her genitals, as they were fundamental parts of her identity.


(vagina)
(if she has a penis too)>Then she moves her dick aside to look at her vagina.
(Prints if she has no penis>(Next she looks at her vagina.)
(+virginity)
 As she prods at her vagina, she feels a slight tightness, and a bit of difficulty as she tries to press her finger inside of herself.  She realizes this body is a virgin!


(+tightness)
She notices she is tighter now then she was before.


(devoted)
While it may be harder now to have sex then it was before, she looks forward to breaking in her new pussy with you.


(not devoted)
She groans in frustration.  She is well aware of how the hard the process is of losing the tightness her pussy now has, and does not look forward to it.


(-tightness)
She notices how she is now looser than she was before.


(devoted)
She giggles a bit as she tests out how many fingers she can fit inside her new loose hole.  


(not devoted)
She frowns as she feels out how much looser she is now.  She supposes it doesn’t matter, but it is humiliating how many more fingers she can fit now.


(butt)
The last thing she learns is how 


(bigger)
Much bigger her butt is now.  As she turns around she sees it has grown


(+1 size)
A fair bit. 
(+more sizes)
A lot.
(+to max size description or above)
An incredible amount.


(devoted)
This is a pleasing development, and she looks forward to putting this new butt to the test with you.
(if extreme size)
She is overwhelmed by how large her new butt is.  She can barely stand under its weight.


(not devoted)
While she’s not terribly upset, this still feels like a violation of her, somehow.  Still, there are worse things that could happen then waking up with a bigger butt.
(if extreme size)
She is overwhelmed by how large her new butt is.  She can barely stand under its weight.




(smaller)
Much smaller her butt is now.  As she turns around she sees it has shrunk


(+1 size)
A fair bit.
(+more sizes)
A lot.


(devoted)
She is saddened that there is now less of her for you to play with, but remembers that you chose this body for her, and hopes that you will still make use of her butt.


(not devoted)
This is just depressing to her.  A butt is one of the two parts of her body that almost every women (or “women”) is defined by, and now she feels like just that much less of a person.
(+butt implants)
She also notes that there are implants in her, as her prodding reveals a certain stiffness in her ass’s shape. 


(devoted)
It pleases her that you would invest in such a minor way in her body.


(not devoted)
It feels like you have modified her in a such a minor way for your own benefit, and she doesn’t kid herself in thinking otherwise.


(-butt implants)
She also notes that she no longer has butt implants, as her experimentation reveals a more natural bounce to her buttocks.


(devoted)
She is happy that you think her body doesn’t need any artificial modification to be pleasing.


(not devoted)
She views this as one less thing she didn’t have a choice in.
