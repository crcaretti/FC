Several weeks have passed since you gained the musical prodigy and you couldn't help but notice her constant scowl and muttering about "getting revenge one day" or "wishing her producer would pay for what happened" whenever she was not working. You decide to look into the incident after the concert and direct $assistantName to look into the financial situation of her record label. It turns out that not only should this slave not be eligible for enslavement due to loads of money coming in after each concert, but a certain someone has been taking that money for themselves, including the income of their subordinate. You issue a bounty for the producer and wait a while for an answer. With surprising speed, an answer comes from a bounty hunter. They never left the arcology, instead opting to make use of the guest living arrangements you had set up for the concert. Only when an announcement of the bounty went out did they try to escape and the bounty hunter caught them right by the gate. The bounty hunter literally drags the escapee by the collar into your penthouse and throws them at your feet. The coward shivers as your eyes meet theirs.

"Please, don't hurt me! I'll pay for that slave I sent you to be released, even set her up with the life she would have had if I hadn't embezzled the profits." 

 Just as the coward at your feet finishes, $activeslave walks in, her face quickly donning a scowl of pure anger and hatred.

"$PCtitle, please let me have my revenge on this despicable lowlife. I promise not to kill them, just hurt them enough to let them know the suffering they caused me."

You inform the coward at your feet that the slave in question is long gone, making them panic even more at their grim situation.

[[Enslave]] if the player still holds the slave from the first event = "You decide to spare the coward from their former subordinate's wrath and simply take enslave them."

[[Enslave]] if the slave from the first event was sold prior to this one = "You spare the coward the pain and humiliation you feel she deserves and simply enslave them."

[[Enslave and allow $activeslave to seek revenge]] if the player still holds the slave from the first event = "You decide to give the victimized prodigy a chance for payback. She moves over to her former boss and begins to caress the despicable coward as she shakes in total fear of what is to come. As she moves lower, she applies more pressure, peaking right on the genitals. The cowardly former producer yelps in pain, instinctively trying to get away from the hand crushing the most sensitive spot on her body. After several minutes of the coward screaming in pain, the former prodigy gets up and delivers a hard kick to the groin, eliciting another scream and causing her former boss to assume the fetal position. You send for another slave to escort the whimpering former producer to work." 

[[Enslave and Punish]] if the slave from the first event was sold prior to this one = "You decide the coward needs more punishment. You order a whip brought to you and give her several lashes directly on her bare genetalia. She cries out and a red line appears on each whip strike, some even bleeding slightly. After the yelps stop, you feel enough punishment has been given and send the producer turned slave off."
